For instance, we won’t be trying to onboard them to our specific marketplace. We’ll relate artist to artist.",
      "full_solution": "The planned solution has two components and deliverables.\n\n  \n\n\n1. A series of guides featuring rich interactive infographics and text.\n2. On-demand, in-person, one on one consultancy sessions with NFT project creators and developers (to be conducted over video calls).\n\n  \n\n\nFrom experience, we have found that this is by far the most effective way to attract & onboard.\n\n  \n\n\nThe sessions will be 2 hours in length each, and cover a range of topics, starting from subjects from the guides, but adapting and evolving them according to the needs of each project.\n\n  \n\n\nOver the course of the last year, we have already offered consultancy sessions to artists and projects, either preparing to launch on Cardano or entirely new to the ecosystem, successfully onboarding them.\n\n  \n\n\nThe role of the guides that we plan to produce in tandem with the consultancy sessions is twofold:\n\n  \n\n\n1. As support materials that expand on the information the consultancy sessions will offer.\n2. Serve as a marketing and promotional material to attract and onboard new projects to Cardano.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nJust a few examples of subjects and themes to be covered by the guides:\n\n  \n\n\n* The fact that on Cardano NFTs are actual native tokens, which live on the blockchain at the same level as ADA, not in a smart contract that can be exploited, as we have seen happen repeatedly.\n* The low energy consumption of the Cardano blockchain, which thus has a very low carbon footprint, making it much more environmentally friendly\n* The incredibly low minting costs.\n* The very low transaction fees.\n* The fact that, unlike ETH, Cardano does not experience failed transactions - worst case a tx results in a refund which requires minimal transaction fees.\n* The vibrant and helpful developer community that can assist with technical problems if they were to emerge.\n* The friendly and supportive nature of a large part of the Cardano NFT community.\n* The huge potential for growth of the entire Cardano ecosystem, when compared to ETH. Becoming a part of the ecosystem now will almost surely make you an early adopter.\n* The spirit of innovation and pioneering of the entire Cardano ecosystem that is also manifested in the NFT space.\n* And many more.\n\n  \n\n\nThe consultancy sessions will be on-demand and free of charge for interested projects. Each project will be able to book up to a maximum of 5 sessions over the course of its development.\n\n  \n\n\nWe expect, on average, each project to book 2-3 sessions, our aim is to offer consultancy to 20-25 projects.",

However, this will not mean that they will be our only target audience. As part of the initiative, we will also look to present the advantages of Cardano to already existent projects in the hopes that they will either look into bridging their existing NFT projects to Cardano when that becomes a technical possibility or choose to launch upcoming projects, spin-offs, or sequels on Cardano.

Together with Social app revenue, we fund a professional-grade curriculum for our youth and provide the accompanying Social Technology Stack for Digital Conversations. \n\n  \n\n\nRisk - A new way to approach user interaction.\n\n  \n\n\n Because of the new nature of Story-based Chat Assistants, we need specific knowledge and Motion UI front-end skill. Because Conversational Interaction Design is a new front-end UI approach for Blockchain, but re-imagining pages into conversations simplifies things considerably, because the dependencies are less complex.\n\n  \n\n\n We coordinate with production partners and use our Social R&D tools to learn and build together using the user experience perspective. We are taking away risks because many eyes, expertise, passion, and way of working come together in our Live classes.\n\n \n\n By co-designing with our Partners, the Catalyst, Cardano, and Broader communities, we incorporate honest feedback captured in social design sessions, fine-tuning the design tools and instructional materials even further.\n\n  \n\n\n\n> The best way to learn is to teach and iterate. We consider social design a peer review method for iterative UI design, removing the churn we experience in Catalyst today.\n\n  \n\n\n Risk - Lack of research / live class participants\n\nIn web2 it's often hard to find research candidates or participants, but the web3 community is earger to learn, participate and provide feedback. \n\n  \n\n\nWe concur with the finding of Oliver/IOHK, especially #2 about finding participants.\n\n  \n\n\n\"The community is supercharged!

But our current wallet software separates utility and education, creating barriers for people to enter and trust the crypto space and partake in meaningful use cases.\n\n \n\nCatalyst has its challenges. To effectively work with people you might never have met before, and break out of discovery talks only, we need a new approach to our way of working. \n\n \n\nWe need a new social design approach turns everybody into a designer, unlocking the power of our human potential through cognitive diversity.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n New UX 3.0 method & Social Design Instructors\n\n  \n\n\nLast few years, I designed new Social UX tools that brought me closer to the vision of developing Software that has positive impacts on our daily lives. But I must admit, I have been trying to put this on the Catalyst agenda since Fund2 and resources are running low. Rethinking systems using Design Research takes a lot of time and packaging these outcomes for a larger audience are two different things. That why I ask for your investment to launch the Social Design Academy.\n\n \n\nTo assist people in their Cardano journey, we must upgrade how our Communities and Brands interact with their audiences & clients. We must elevate the repetitive, harsh, static page-based Software using UX 3.0 in which we transition from 'Designing for convenience' to 'Designing for wellbeing' using engaging digital storytelling. Humane software asks people what they need instead of telling them what to do. At Social Design Academy, we are mindful of what we build with Blockchain in our social live classes.\n\n  \n\n\n\"Together, we design a new category of Social Apps that deliver personal and collective development goals using Story-based Chat Assistants. \" - NK.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nWith your investment, Social Design Academy launches a new UX3.0 program that turns communities & brands into forces for good. [Check our SDA budget and roadmap]\n\n  \n\n\nLet's discover these new perspectives together.\n\n  \n\n\n\n> 2 - Your reasons for approaching it in the way that you have;\n\nMost of us have seen the slide in Catalyst Townhall once or twice; \"Catalyst disorients, overloads, and inspires.\" The decentralized nature of the space causes adverse effects, mainly because people don't know where to start or progress, often reaching out to family, friends & Social Media for help.\n\n  \n\n\\*\\*The Functional/ Strategy Perspective\\*\n\n  \n\n\n Page-based interaction design for the web is getting old; we need to rethink the front-end UI for Blockchain to unleash its full potential. Why? Pages are passive and reactive; they don't pro-actively inspire and encourage people to join the Cardano ecosystem.  \n\n \n\nSocial Design Academy focuses on distributed software design (we also call it real social software). Redefining how we build distributed software doesn't happen overnight and needs some serious unlearning and relearning, we develop and streamline what and how we make by capturing design research, having live classes and re-imagening what software can do for us as humans.\n\n \n\nSocial Design Academy believes in coordinating live classes and workshops around distributed software that compounds in a Conversational UI Toolkit leveraging bright minds in the Catalyst, Cardano, and broader software development space. \n\n \n\n By rethinking how we design and develop our front-end and node-systems together, we can not only create a bridge between our web2 and web3 worlds; we make the web fun and meaningful again. By using moral imagination, we deliver true social impact. 🔥  \n\n \n\nEverybody can join collaborative our design workshops, we turn people into civilian design thinkers and doers.\n\n  \n\n\n\n> 3 - Who your project will engage, or who its stakeholders are;\n\nSocial Design Academy is already engaging with the Catalyst & Cardano community daily in our Discord and by having weekly live classes that use these new design tools like; UX reviews, Pain & Gain Personas & Experience mapping. And from July '22 forward we want to intensify our online events.\n\n  \n\n\n Niels Kijf is Social UX Advisor for Consenz and provides the Cardano ecosystem with new design tools to find product-market-fit, of which Emotion Mapping and Pain & Gain are the most effective. Design with emotion, not for emotion, is a core Social Design Principle and simplifies how we connect with our audiences. \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nIn our latest workshop, we concluded that the new Ideascale proposal template triggers anxiety and stress—[Reference 6 - Emotion mapping] Our Proposal Assistant will be an iterative design research to show novel proposal writing processes using the distributed collaboration mindset. [Reference 7 - Design research Chat Assistant for Cardano].\n\n  \n\n\n 'If you don't design with your customer, you are not designing for your customer.'\n\n  \n\n\n To boost our outreach, we coach Social Design Instructors that using Social R&D tools within communities & brands co-create experience maps [Reference 8 - XP map example] that are self-explanatory, stress-free, and meaningful. Together we unlock the true potential of Cardano using our new Social Design tools and Story-based Chat Assistant techniques. \n\n  \n\n\n\n> 4 - How will your project be implemented?\n\n  \n\n\nVisualise to Realise; We can do it!\n\n  \n\n\nCatalyst is missing Iterative Design Circles, UI design groups that engage and encourage blockchain communities with mockups, fresh ideas, and directions by showing UI designs for Digital Governance solutions. Using modern design tools, we get people excited about design, and by asking for feedback on social media, we show people potential directions. \n\n  \n\nIn my almost 25 years of experience as a Digital product designer, people get excited when you show potential approaches and directions in UI design mockups. \n\n  \n\nPeople become creative, asking questions like: \"Is this also possible? Did you think about this?\" This shift the mindset from seeing obstacles to creating a yes-and environment for future design iterations.\n\n  \n\nWe train social UX basics in our live classes [Reference 9 - RSVP Channel] and excite people through loom recordings discussing design. We democratize and humanize our software design, a mission with only winners. [Reference 10 - De-colonize Design thinking.pdf]\n\n  \n\nSocial Design Academy wants to step into the Civilian Design Space using the following Japanese proverb;\n\n  \n\n  Tell people, and they Forget,\n\n  Show people, and they Remember,\n\n  Involve people, and they will Understand.\n\n  \n\n\n\n> 5a - What you will produce (i.e., your outputs)\n\n  \n\n\nMonetize Digital Storytelling\n\n  \n\n\nBy co-designing UX 3.0, together with the Social Design Academy Pitch/Co-investor deck, we engage with Communities & Brands with a new Social Appstore concept. Monetizing Digital Storytelling in new Social Apps outside of the walled gardens will drive adoption for the Cardano Ecosystem, as our world is in desperate need of new hope narratives.\n\n \n\nOur Proposal Assistant will be used as example project in our Live classes. From September onwards we will bring these topics to our live-classes and partners, while I button up F6: In-wallet Onboarding for ADAholder, before Sept 1st, 2022. Learning and building together is our core philosophy, as we believe unlearning and relearning in groups work best.\n\n  \n\n\nWe make Communities & Brands Blockchain Ready™ by introducing a new way of developing their business client interactions using Story Based Chat Assistants. Instead of social media creating our world views, we are transforming our phones into remote controls for our reality. \n\n  \n\n\n Doesn't that sound refreshing?\n\n  \n\nFor our complete approach, check our Budgets, Milestones, and design program, see our SDA budget/roadmap and program spreadsheet.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\nProduction Overview\n\n  \n\n\n Stage A & B - Social UX & Digital Storytelling Workshop | Gitbook Instructional Materials WIP\n\n  \n\n\n  Through Social R&D, we are co-producing two workshops: Social UX & Conversational Interaction Design that redefine how we ideate and co-design real social Software using our distributed software mindset. These workshops use Miro boards & Discord as communication tools.

By co-designing a Conversational UI Toolkit, we redirect our energy from software delivery to value deliver\n4. We promote brands that are in the process of becoming a force for goo\n5. By creating the Conversational UI Toolkit with partners\\*, we want to leverage what we can build on the Cardano blockchain.\n\n  \n\n\n\\* We are currently talking with LITTLEFISH, ADAO, HANDSHAKE, and KONMA as production partners for this Cardano UI Toolkit. We hope other communities join us in this exciting digital storytelling journey, making Cardano streetwise and the Social Impact chain of choice.\n\n  \n\n\n\n> 6 - Explain who will benefit.\n\n The delivery of this project benefits the Catalyst, Cardano, and broader software development communities as we venture into the world to create a bridge between our web2 and web3 world using a humane software design approach. \n\n  \n\n\n 'Together we stand, Divided we fall.'",
