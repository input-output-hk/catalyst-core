This approach also removes the East versus the West binary and allows us to recognize that people everywhere are affected by systems that are too complex to challenge.\u00a0\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt is also important to begin thinking this way because it lifts everyone up as opposed to creating a siloed improvement. It is important to realize and understand that these challenges are not unique, they are Global.\u00a0 Absent and deteriorating economic identity is spread across the world and that is because of social, economic, and political factors.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAn additional factor that this proposal addresses is the transitioning from traditional labor models and creating the globalization of the gig economy. The \"gig\" or contractor labor pool is the largest growing labor force in the world and that will continue well through the next decade if not become the permanent form of \"work\".\u00a0\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt is also important to consider that the gig economy is growing not because companies and corporations are inherently bad but rather because of regulations and statutes, laws that create a system where businesses cannot operate profitably.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe final reason this proposal is a defining moment in Cardano''s story, is the fact that it goes beyond imaginary lines and allows the community to focus efforts on areas that are in desperate need or show great opportunity for mass adoption.", "importance": "This is important to Cardano because it places emphasis on the socio-economic and political identity of everyone.", "goal": "Successful proposals will be able to deliver shared solutions that have an impact in multiple regions, countries, and continents.", "metrics": "Number of teams on one proposal  \r\nNumber of proposals submitted by the same group of teams  \r\nNumber of proposal teams created that have not worked together before.  \r\nCategories of cross border cultural sharing.\u00a0  \r\nNumber of Countries represented on one proposal."}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "Currently, the vast majority of DeFi dapps and assets flows occur on the Ethereum blockchain, however due to congestion and increased transaction fees, the use of DeFi is increasingly elitized, leaving out the people who could most benefit from it, the unbanked.\r\n\r\nOver the past year several DeFi projects have been moving to more scalable blockchains, such as Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, Cosmos, Solana, among others. Second layer solutions are also being used as alternatives to Ethereum main chain, Polygon has been a great example.\r\n\r\nIn this migration and bridges creation scenario, some projects are turning to Cardano to create their DeFi projects.\r\n\r\nCardano is finally delivering smart contracts and that opens a door to a lot of innovation in DeFi. We can offer not only a scalable blockchain, but also a secure blockchain and aggregated governance layer in the near future. This set of characteristics place Cardano in a prominent place and with a good opportunity to gain market share and expand the user base.\r\n\r\nWith Catalyst, we have the opportunity to fund DeFi projects and allow them to have greater decentralization and resilience, which are essential aspects for DeFi projects. Many projects end up accepting the participation of Venture Capitals due to lack of financial resources. The participation of VCs in DeFi projects usually ends up causing a large part of the supply distribution to be alocated to VCs and this compromises the decentralization and consequently the security of these projects.\r\n\r\nThe DeFi ecosystem today is taken over by projects full of vulnerabilities, hacks are constant, economic models are copied from other projects, decentralization is no longer a priority and few projects are dedicated to create economic models/bonding curves/algorithms thinking about the users'' needs.\r\n\r\nIt has become clear over the year that bugs, hacks and vulnerabilities are not unique to smart contracts on Ethereum. Dapps running on Binance Smart Chain and Cosmos suffered from vulnerabilities as well.\r\n\r\nhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/hackers-stole-at-least-600m-in-poly-exploit-across-three-chains\r\n\r\nhttps://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/111660/thorchain-suffers-5-million-exploit-developers-have-put-out-a-fix\r\n\r\nCardano arrives to change this paradigm and bring security to users.\r\n\r\nPrivacy and resistance to censorship are also important but often overlooked in favor of subsidizing (yield farming). How to encourage DeFi projects to seek resilience, safety, research-based economic models and critical thinking?\r\n\r\nPOTENTIAL DIRECTIONS\r\n\r\n*   DEXs\r\n*   Oracles\r\n*   Algorithmic stable coins\r\n*   Borrowing/Lending dapps\r\n*   Derivatives\r\n*   Research for open source new financial models (bonding curves)\r\n\r\nRATIONALE FOR BUDGET DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nNew or less popular teams have difficulty competing with influential and popular teams in the Cardano community. Even ensuring a good score is difficult to get engagement in the voting stage to compete with consolidated and influential teams in the Cardano community.\r\n\r\nThis challenge intends to sow new teams, who have never received funding from Catalyst so they can have a chance to show their value to the community.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nEach new team can request up to 25% of the total $200,000 USD budget, also know as $50,000 USD.\r\n\r\nE.g.\r\n\r\n*   Team A with 2 proposals of $25,000 USD\r\n*   Team B with 5 proposals of $10,000 USD\r\n*   Team C with 1 proposal of $50,000 USD\r\n*   Team D with 1 proposal of $15,000 USD + 1 proposal of $35,000 US\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe 200,000 USD budget has been set so that it can accommodate the demand seen in previous Funds for DeFi-related proposals in the \"Scale-UP Cardano''s DeFi Ecosystem\" and \"Dapps & Integrations\" challenges. It is also important to take into account that DeFi dApps sometimes require more experienced developers due to the nature of DeFi dapps requiring high levels of guarantee, after all they are mission critical applications and the smart contracts of these dApps will guarantee the safety of users and large amounts Of money.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that 25% is the maximum amount of aggregated budget that the same team can request in this challenge, but any amount below that can be requested. This means that the challenge will have space for at least 4 proposals from different teams, which guarantees greater chances for teams with less popularity and that may be overshadowed by more popular teams in the community.\r\n\r\nIn the image below(see atachments) it is possible to see several dapp projects related to DeFi that are being developed on Cardano''s blockchain (DEXs, Lending+Borrowing, Stable Coins, Synthetic Assets, Oracles, Derivatives and Insurance)", "importance": "So that new teams can have a kickstart in their projects without having to resort to ICOs and VCs\u00a0 allocation.", "goal": "At least 4 new teams deploying DeFi dapps on Cardano in 2022 + Managing to form a community in order to gain competitiveness/susteinability", "metrics": "*   How many DeFi dapps were launched on Cardano mainnet within 3, 6 and 12 months after funding.\r\n*   How many daily active users are the DeFi dapps funded in this cohort attracting.\r\n*   How long does each dapp take to be launched.\r\n*   How much Total Value Locked (TVL) are the funded DeFi dapps able to capture 3, 6 and 12 months after launch.\r\n*   Number of bugs and vulnerabilities found in each dapp.\r\n*   Amount of resources lost due to bugs or vulnerabilities.\r\n*   Number of users participating in testnets.\r\n*   Number of token holders/unique wallet(when dapp has a token).\r\n*   Distribution of supply between the team and the community.\r\n*   Numbers of listed pairs (in case of DEXs).\r\n*   Number of listed assets (cases of loan+lending dapps, derivatives and synthetic assets).\r\n*   Number of articles and open source financial models research delivered to the community."}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "Translation of the proposal can be found here:\u00a0\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1wOPyqYMAZhJdsiM808_oSAkNC62zoInpQcpEc2WXKqg/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nWhy is this challenge important?\r\n\r\nThere has been an interest in Cardano in Japan from the start and the country has had a progressive stance towards blockchain technology. This makes Japan a likely country to adopt solutions built on top of Cardano. There are already some active community members and SPO''s but participation in Catalyst is still relatively low.\u00a0\r\n\r\nRecently an Eastern Town Hall was started by community members and participation in the Japanese breakout room has been among the highest consistently. In the fund 6 challenges there are several proposals coming from the Japanese community as well. With the current momentum a challenge in fund 7 would likely see good participation and can solidify the community.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAt the moment most of Ideascale & Catalyst operates in english. This creates a barrier for all non-english communities. If solutions from this challenge prove successful in bridging that gap, they can function as an example for other communities.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nChallenge Brief\r\n\r\nThe goal of this challenge is to find ways to further engage the Japanese community and to help create ways for the Japanese and English speaking community to connect. Proposers are encouraged to propose in Japanese and the Challenge team will help promote the CA role in the Eastern Town hall or equivalent event.\r\n\r\nThe budget is set to 50k because the Challenge focuses only on a specific part of the community. There are also projects from Japan which have a broad application and will fit in other challenges. Considering the focus is on community building the budget should be enough to support 2-6 meaningful efforts.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nPossible directions:\r\n\r\nTranslating key documentation\r\n\r\nCreating educational content about Cardano & Catalyst in Japanese\r\n\r\nOrganising interpreters for Catalyst events\r\n\r\nOrganising workshops for new members, CA''s, SPO''s, proposers\r\n\r\nSetting up community hubs\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nChallenge Team\r\n\r\nThe Challenge team consists of two active members from the Japanese community and one member from the general community. Among them there is experience with proposing & facilitating. The challenge team members have previously helped with the organising both Eastern Town Hall (Japan Breakout) and After Town Hall sessions\r\n\r\n

With this challenge, our community can provide funding for those on the ground to build upon their awareness of the Cardano protocol. Doing so will allow blockchain solutions for African problems to come from Africans.\r\n\r\nWithin our community we have some outstanding people in Africa that I''ve met who are working with us to grow the ecosystem. Yet infrastructure and funding to enable them to work more easily with one another is still lacking. Let''s give our fellow community members a funding category they can point to within their local communities as a means to take part in this revolution of technology. In doing so we will be enabling our ecosystem to make improvements within African communities.\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming majority of stake pools are based in North America and Europe. The Cardano protocol will be much more resilient and productive for people all around the world when the Catalyst community steps up and intentionally funds communities in every region to build out our network in a more geographically decentralized manner.\r\n\r\nAddressing these issues in Africa and other parts of the world directly through funding challenges such as this gives them access to our community and our resources,\u00a0 and thereby a means of support as they engage with the Cardano ecosystem and work to empower their neighbors in taking advantage of this powerful technology.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI''d like to be clear that there is no attempt on my part here to earn any reward for this proposal. I do not believe it needs a team for autonomous people to be able to make proposals that help people from this region to take part in the Cardano ecosystem. Teams will continue to form organically, as they have been for the past year.\r\n\r\nI trust the community to make constructive comments and I trust the gradually improving assessment process to weed out charlatans.\r\n\r\nThe amount of funding I am proposing equals 6.25 % of the total available for Fund 7. My suggestion is that this is a nice percentage to use as a guide for future rounds when funding increases for all of the challenges that focus on specific regions.", "importance": "The Cardano community is heavily based in North America and Europe.\r\n\r\nGrowth elsewhere requires our support and initiative as a community.", "goal": "A wide spectrum of people across Africa, or from Africa, coming together and forming teams to grow our ecosystem with tools provided by us.", "metrics": "*   The number and quality of funded proposals originating from Africans themselves.\r\n*   An increasing number of Plutus Pioneer graduates from Africa.\r\n*   Greater and more economical communication between African members of the Cardano community due to infrastructure improvements.\r\n*   A higher number of Africans involved with the Catalyst community.\r\n*   Solutions created by Africans to problems that people all over the world share."}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "++Introduction and Summary++\r\n\r\nThis challenge will be about aligning Catalyst''s interests with that of its community and society in general. The challenge for fund 7 should be to take Catalyst to the streets by financing, at a 75% level (open to changes), various community proposed projects with a common goal. The original idea was that these outlets/businesses would have one thing in common: any sales made in ADA would come at a 10/15/20% discount. For example, a coffee or restaurant which sells a coffee at 1$ would sell it at 0.85$ (15% discount) if paid in ADA.\u00a0 However, proposers could come up with other creative ways to incentivise and facilitate adoption of ADA through their projects.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this new challenge is to fund at a 75% aid intensity proposed projects which incentivise adoption of Cardano. This challenge would involve inactive people already present within Catalyst since it opens up Catalyst for anybody who wants to start his/her own business. The reason for not fully funding the project is that one would want some accountability by the proposer.\u00a0\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nRefund Process\r\n\r\n2/5% of all sales generated (depending on the operating margin of the business) is to be sent back to the treasury (or a separate treasury specifically for the challenge). On a base case, I would expect that investment is fully returned after 5 years time. However, evaluation of projects is crucial and must be strictly conducted.\u00a0\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSpreading adoption / Avoiding Concentration of projects\r\n\r\nI would suggest that such fund be divided in countries where only 1 project per country can be awarded per fund. There can be a bonus project with double the fund allocation to allow for market penetration in acclaimed areas where rent costs (amongst others) would be much higher. This project is giving incentives to people to join the Cardano ecosystem by providing them with financial motivation to have their project funded. Secondly, once a funded project is up and running, customers of this project''s business would have a reason why they should hold at least in a small portion, some ADA currency. The reason being to have a discount for their purchases.\r\n\r\nThe business must clearly advertise the ''discount'' and in case where there are sales persons or cashier''s they must clearly tell each customer that there is a discount for those paying with ADA.\r\n\r\nAlso, there must be a sign where it says \"Funded by Project Catalyst (Cardano)\".\u00a0\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nE-commerce portals\r\n\r\nThis is also very easily done on websites with an online payment option, where a discount is shown to apply if you chose the ''pay with ADA'' option.\u00a0\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n++Evaluating a proposal++\r\n\r\nA business plan with clear revenue and profit forecasts must be put forward. Rationale of how one arrived to the figures must be clear and expenses must be substantiated by evidence where possible. Community advisors should have a background in finance or be successful entrepreneurs themselves. Ideally a scoring sheet is agreed one, a project would at least need 50% to be considered and then stars allocated accordingly to scoring.\r\n\r\n*Diversification from competitors:*\r\n\r\nThe idea is to incentivise people to set-up a wallet and purchase ADA. Projects which are diverse from the competition should be preferred. So we are talking about product differentiation, price competition, innovative products.\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Location:*\r\n\r\nObviously, highly frequented locations would be preferred since they would have the greatest potential since they would reach much more people.\r\n\r\n*Grant requested:*\r\n\r\nThe higher the grant requested the lower the score. This would automatically balance other evaluation criteria (eg. location) and the right balance between exposure (for proposals in densely populated areas and popular neighborhoods) and cost of investment (proposals in popular neighborhoods would naturally require a higher investment).\r\n\r\n*Time of completion:*\r\n\r\nThe lower the time of completion of the proposal, the higher the score. We want proposals to be set-up in a short time to start making an effect as fast as possible. A maximum limit of time (eg. 1.5 years) should be also put in place.\r\n\r\n*Readiness of proposer:*\r\n\r\nThe readier and the more prepared a prospective entrepreneur is, the better. Does the propose already have a lease contract in hand? Has the proposer contacted and acquired quotations for work needed? Has contact with suppliers been established? Has and marketing study been undertaken to identify the need for the business (especially in case of innovative ideas or niche markets) ?\r\n\r\n*Capability and experience of entrepreneur:*\r\n\r\nIs the entrepreneur knowledgeable in the proposed business venture? Has the proposer owned or does he/she still own similar businesses or any business at all?\u00a0\r\n\r\n*Branding and Copyright:*\r\n\r\nThis has not been tackled yet and ideally a brand would be set up by IOHK with free licensing to the selected projects or even external investors upon review of their project. This licence could also be used to set an agreement for the 2/5% revenue \u00b4fee\u00b4 (which then the treasury should hold the licensing rights). It would be very powerful for Cardano to build an empire of \"Caf\u00e8 ADA\" around the globe. How could it be ignored? Or even have the ''ADA journal'' or ''Cardano Times'' with its newsroom. As long as the projects are profitable, the treasury will grow exponentially and in 10 years any project would be practically possible.\u00a0\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n++Auditability++\r\n\r\nHow do you know that the proposer is respecting the terms of the grant?\r\n\r\nFirst of all, when issuing the grant, it has to be done upon presentation of invoices, proof of payment and evidence of work done. Community advisors can do this, or a separate committee appointed.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the way payments in ADA are to be effected would be though a QR code displayed on the cashier counter. The code would hold the business wallet address. This should be a function which will become present in wallets.\r\n\r\nNow, how does one ensure that these guidelines are being followed ? One should first rely on the community to flag irregularities.\u00a0 As the community is quite large and continues to grow, it should be enough to regulate or check these businesses (simply by visiting these places). Secondly, especially at the start of the challenge, a set of mystery shoppers can be tasked to visit certain place at a certain frequency to ensure that the project is reaching its goals. One would simply have people shop at these businesses and report back. Mystery shopper should be paid say 50$ in ADA for each visit.\u00a0\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHow does the business make a profit if it has lower margins than the discount offered?\r\n\r\nThe discount given to ADA payers would be essentially written off against the rest of the sales. Furthermore, most businesses like supermarkets, coffee shops and bars have higher profit margins than 20%. Besides the margin, one has to consider the fixed costs including rent, wages, water and electricity and more. However, once the business scales there will be enough sales to cater for these expenses. Problems could arise if the ADA sales represent a sizable portion of total sales. This is highly unlikely especially at the early stages, nonetheless, in this case the discounts can be scaled down proportionally with the increase in ADA paid sales.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nReporting back to Catalyst:\r\n\r\nIt is important that the proposal winners submit monthly reports on the Sales made in ADA as compared to other sales (cash or card). Reporting should include, Sales value in ADA vs Total Sales Value, Number of sales in ADA vs Total number of sales, Sales made to Community Wallets (from anonymous wallet register to rewards voters, CAs and VCAs), Payments received from New Wallets (not as accurate since people can have different wallet addresses but still useful) and Repetitive sales to known wallets. Reports shall be strictly confidential and to issue data in percentage terms or absolute numbers.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n++Problems solved++\r\n\r\n*1)Community engagement:*\r\n\r\nThis has often been limited to developers as many people lack knowledge and skills to even put forward a proposal. This challenge opens the gates to literally anybody who is willing to open a business.\r\n\r\n*2)Cardano Exposure:*\r\n\r\nMany proposals talk about marketing and advertisements. Well, what better advertisement that to have a coffe shop named \"Caf\u00e8 ADA\" or \"Cafe Cardano\" in the middle of a busy street which offer large discount for crypto payments. And through the community already existing in Cardano, we can have at least 10 places in various countries open at each Fund round, increasing at an exponential rate through revenue generation of the fund itself.\r\n\r\n*3)Incentivise and Retain Community advisors and voters:*\r\n\r\nOutlets themselves can offer increased discounts to Community Advisors and Voters (a wallet register would be set-up - identity can still be kept anonymous) thereby incentivising participation of both advisors and voters. This can be linked with an eventual honour/tier system which has been proposed for the advisors and voters based on their output.\r\n\r\n*4)Attracting new Entrepreneurs to the Ecosystem:*\r\n\r\nThese sort of grants would definitely attract the ear of various entrepreneurs who either do not have the funding or else do not want to take on the risk of opening their business. Naturally, the set-off would be that any project must incentivise the use or adoption of Cardano.\r\n\r\n5)Expand the network through actual use cases and incentives\r\n\r\nIncetivise the general public to become part of Cardano by offering them a reason to do it - purchase at a discounted rate. Aligning interests of the public of cost savings with those of Cardano.\r\n\r\n*6) Sustainability; A Self-financing Challenge:*\r\n\r\nIf all goes well, this challenge will be self sustaining and could also feed the treasury as a profit will eventually be made by the business and the treasury (be it the existing one or a separate one) will continue to benefit.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n++Attachment: Actual figures from existing coffee shop++\r\n\r\nPlease find attached the figure of an actual coffee shop who is not very popular, an average coffee shop (max capacity 40 persons), operates at some 50% capacity during weekdays and maybe 75% on weekends. The figures have been exchanged from Euro to Dollars. A projection for proposals has been extracted which assumes that there are 10% of total sales made in ADA and that such sales have a 15% discount. Furthermore, a 5% refund to Catalyst has been added. This shows that it is quite doable and that projects are basically refunded after 4-5 years assuming a 100k investment. I myself am a financial advisor (warranted accountant and auditor) dealing with start-ups and creating realistic business plans (often to determine amount of funding required from banks). As part of my job, I also help businesses apply for a number of EU grants and local government funding which adhere to very strict regulations and checks.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n++Existing businesses++\r\n\r\nA fund can be set-up to incentivise existing businesses to introduce crypto payments and offer discounts for ADA payments. This would also apply for those already offering ADA payment options, these would then have to introduce applicable discounts. This can be seen as a marketing fund\u00a0where monthly payments (say $500/m) can be sent out to each business which is chosen. Ideally, for auditability purposes, e-commerce business should be given priority since these can easily be verified just by accessing their website.\r\n\r\n++Funding++\r\n\r\nAssuming a 100,000 grant which would mean an investment of 100,000/0.75=133,333 , a 1,000,000 allocation could finance 10 businesses every funding round or 9 businesses if the double financing project is added. This is a good starting point.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read. Please submit any ideas that you might have to improve this proposal.", "importance": "Inclusion of various inactive members on Catalyst\r\n\r\nHuge potential to attract new people to Cardano\r\n\r\nA self-sustained challenge\r\n\r\n#RealFi", "goal": "Engagment of current members\r\n\r\nAttracting new people to Cardano\r\n\r\nSetting-up of profitable businesses which reach their goals", "metrics": "Proposals put forward by community members who had never posted a proposal before (community engagement)\r\n\r\nTracking winning proposals from new challenge and seeinf they are profitable and slowly refunding the grant rewarded\r\n\r\nCompetitor (competitors of actural businesses set-up throigh the challenge) adoption of crypto payment system (when theg see thwae winning proposals adopt crypto - given also the reduced transaction fees)\r\n\r\nNew community members/entrepreneurs who join Catalyst specifically due to this new challenge"}', -- extra

They lack solutions. Tailor-made applications / use-cases, based on sensible implementations of the Cardano protocol can answer some of those needs.\r\n\r\n*   Decision-makers are often more approachable than those in large countries.\r\n*   Decision-making process is often simpler in small, close knit, relatively homogeneous societies.\r\n*   Often these societies face constraints that require new thinking, new ideas, new solutions.\r\n\r\nThis challenge attempts to fund their efforts to identify needs, scope out tailor made use-cases and begin the proposal implementation process.\r\n\r\nUtility, Growth and Adoption, Sustainability and Competitiveness/Fitness are the four KPI''s for the Cardano Return on Intention.\r\n\r\n\"Competitiveness\"\r\n\r\nOther blockchains have a head start in this space. A small team has implemented a national currency built on Algorand for the Republic of the Marshall Islands. A small island nation, the Marshall Islands has already adopted an Algorand-based National Currency. Promoted by a three man team (sfb tech) without any special experience in blockchain. The story is described online. (Search: How SOV came to Marshall Islands)\"\r\n\r\nThere are many other small countries that can adopt the Cardano blockchain.There are different and better models than the one adopted by the Marshall Islands. Let''s get moving. Let''s keep Cardano competitive.\r\n\r\n\"Scope\"\r\n\r\nThis challenge targets and hopes to fund up to 5 proposals. Each to be funded at a budget of up to $100,000 with disbursements being pre-approved. Funds will be disbursed based on cost of developing and travel necessary to achieve the Key Metrics noted above. The funding and auditing mechanism will be described at a later point in the challenge process. Unallocated funds will remain in the treasury.\r\n\r\nComments and ideas are welcome.\r\n\r\nChallenge Team members having some experience in their general space are welcome. Please connect by DM.\r\n\r\nSuccessful proposals will be selected by the voting community.\r\n\r\n\"Growth and Adoption\"\r\n\r\nCardano is most often criticised for having few use cases. A \"Build it and they will come\" mindset is not the best path growth and adoption.\r\n\r\nThe Cardano community is large, growing and filled with unknown and untapped resources.\r\n\r\nThis challenge seeks to call out those who have ideas, are resourceful, energetic and perhaps know someone or know someone who knows someone who is a decision maker.\u00a0Or an influencer in small resource constrained or underdeveloped countries.", "importance": "Cardano is criticised most for having few use cases. The IOG team can not find & promote every one. The community must engage its resources", "goal": "Proposers identify use-cases for a specific country. Identify & contact decision-makers.

    '{"brief": "\"We are the ones we have been waiting for\" - June Jordan\r\n\r\n\"Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world\" - Nelson Mandela\r\n\r\nLet''s propose ideas that are designed with sustainability at it''s heart, guided by the same founding principle on which Cardano was built upon.\r\n\r\n++Urgent solutions for urgent times++\r\n\r\nMore people around the world are living better lives compared to just a decade ago. More people have access to better healthcare, decent work, and education than ever before. But inequalities and climate change are threatening to undo the gains.\r\n\r\nWith the world increasingly facing the extremely damaging impacts of climate change upon ecosystems, populations and species, the need to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C cannot be contested. Alarming data includes the loss of primary rainforest equivalent to a football pitch every 6 seconds in 2019 leading to dramatic consequences such as soil erosion, flooding, loss of biodiversity, carbon release or fishery livelihoods being threatened in small island developing countries, or the Coral Triangle region in South-East Asia due to warming water temperatures and coral bleaching.\r\n\r\nAt the core of the 2020-2030 decade of action is the need for action to tackle growing poverty, empower women and girls, and address the climate emergency. Sustainable development has been defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\r\n\r\nSustainable development calls for concerted efforts towards building an inclusive, sustainable and resilient future for people and planet.\r\n\r\nFor sustainable development to be achieved, it is crucial to harmonize three core elements: economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection. These elements are interconnected, and all are crucial for the well-being of individuals and societies.\r\n\r\nAction against climate change entails structural behavioural change at an individual and systemic level to embed sustainable practices.\r\n\r\nThis will entail the transition and adoption of frameworks of thinking that ensure sustainability is embedded at all levels of action. From our planetary boundaries to our core social foundations, including all strata of society.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions is an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. To this end, there must be promotion of sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth, creating greater opportunities for all, reducing inequalities, raising basic standards of living, fostering equitable social development and inclusion, and promoting integrated and sustainable management of natural resources and ecosystems.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Investment in inclusive and sustainable economies can unleash significant opportunities for shared prosperity. And the political, technological and financial solutions are within reach. But much greater leadership and rapid, unprecedented changes are needed to align these levers of change with sustainable development objectives. #ForPeopleForPlanet\r\n\r\n\u2022 To achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals, annual investment requirements across all sectors have been estimated at around $5-7 trillion. Current investment levels are far from the scale needed. With global financial assets estimated at over $200 trillion, financing is available, but most of these resources are not being channelled towards sustainable development at the scale and speed necessary to achieve the SDGs and objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Interest and investment in the Sustainable Development Goals are growing and investment in the Goals makes economic sense. Achieving the SDGs could open up US$12 trillion of market opportunities and create 380 million new jobs by 2030.\r\n\r\nCardano Sustainability\r\n\r\nEncouraging the growth of a Community Led Local Hubs Network as a means of accelerating and expanding the Cardano ecosystem in strategic places for high SDG impact:\r\n\r\nOut of the world''s approximately 7.8 billion inhabitants, 6.45 billion do not speak English as their first language. Living in the Western world, one may forget this fact, with many never having considered it.\r\n\r\nLet''s consider it now.\r\n\r\nLet''s build an ecosystem that grows sustainably, in harmony from the local to global scale, while remaining inclusive and equitable.\r\n\r\nWhen you drive grassroots adoption, you do more than just ''build cool products''; you empower people to change their lives and world in previously unimaginable ways. You give them the tools to imagine that anything is possible.\r\n\r\nRemember that the Bitcoin network is one protocol of the 75% of blockchains that use Proof of Work (PoW) mining power to reach consensus.\r\n\r\nWith consensus on the Cardano blockchain through Ouroboros estimated to be over four-million times more energy-efficient than the Bitcoin protocol - let''s use the tools available to us today to help build a sustainable world.\r\n\r\nIn a world where Cardano exists, maybe we don''t have to wish for these things to happen, we make them happen!\r\n\r\nEACH PROPOSAL PUT FORWARD FOR THIS CHALLENGE CAN REQUEST FUNDS AMOUNTING TO NO MORE THAN A MAXIMUM OF 20% OF THE TOTAL FUND AVAILABLE.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS TO PROMOTE AND ENCOURAGE A DIVERSITY OF PROPOSALS :)\r\n\r\n++Guiding Budget Rationale:++\r\n\r\n*   Basic infrastructure costs\r\n*   Developer Training, Education and Tools\r\n*   Catalyst Proposer Onboarding\r\n*   Translation and Outreach\r\n*   And more\u2026\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n++For more information:++\r\n\r\n\\* https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/\r\n\r\n\\* https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-launch-esd-2030-roadmap-africa-region\r\n\r\n\\* https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000374802\r\n\r\n\\* https://forum.cardano.org/t/world-computers-that-don-t-cost-the-earth/41259\r\n\r\n\\* https://forum.cardano.org/t/consensus-on-cardano-vs-other-blockchains/38738\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n++Videos on sustainability:++\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkg2XMTWV4g\r\n\r\n 1.

    '{"brief": "THIS CHALLENGE INTENDED TO REPLACE \"Scale-UP Cardano''s DeFi Ecosystem\".\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe previous challenge(ScaleUP Cardano''s DeFi Ecosystem) demonstrated success and allowed popular DeFi projects such as Liqwid Finance, Minswap and ErgoDEX to be funded by the treasury, without the participation of venture capitals and with fair launch models, allowing sustainable distribution of the supply among the community/userbase.\r\n\r\nThe fact that ERGODEX''s proposal was the second best voted proposal in the Left-Over budget is an important indicator to demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposals presented in Fund5.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nCurrently, the vast majority of DeFi dapps and assets flows occur on the Ethereum blockchain, however due to congestion and increased transaction fees, the use of DeFi is increasingly elitized, leaving out the people who could most benefit from it, the unbanked.\r\n\r\nOver the past year several DeFi projects have been moving to more scalable blockchains, such as Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, Cosmos, Solana, among others. Second layer solutions are also being used as alternatives to Ethereum main chain, Polygon has been a great example.\r\n\r\nIn this migration and bridges creation scenario, some projects are turning to Cardano to create their DeFi projects.\r\n\r\nCardano is finally delivering smart contracts and that opens a door to a lot of innovation in DeFi. We can offer not only a scalable blockchain, but also a secure blockchain and aggregated governance layer in the near future. This set of characteristics place Cardano in a prominent place and with a good opportunity to gain market share and expand the user base.\r\n\r\nWith Catalyst, we have the opportunity to fund DeFi projects and allow them to have greater decentralization and resilience, which are essential aspects for DeFi projects.\u00a0Many projects end up accepting the participation of Venture Capitals due to lack of financial resources. The participation of VCs in DeFi projects usually ends up causing a large part of the supply distribution to be alocated to VCs and this compromises the decentralization and consequently the security of these projects.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe DeFi ecosystem today is taken over by projects full of vulnerabilities, hacks are constant, economic models are copied from other projects, decentralization is no longer a priority and few projects are dedicated to create economic models/bonding curves/algorithms thinking about the users'' needs.\r\n\r\nIt has become clear over the year that bugs, hacks and vulnerabilities are not unique to smart contracts on Ethereum. Dapps running on Binance Smart Chain and Cosmos suffered from vulnerabilities as well.\r\n\r\nhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/hackers-stole-at-least-600m-in-poly-exploit-across-three-chains\r\n\r\nhttps://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/111660/thorchain-suffers-5-million-exploit-developers-have-put-out-a-fix\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nCardano arrives to change this paradigm and bring security to users.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nPrivacy and resistance to censorship are also important but often overlooked in favor of subsidizing (yield farming). How to encourage DeFi projects to seek resilience, safety, research-based economic models and critical thinking?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nPOTENTIAL DIRECTIONS\r\n\r\n*   DEXs\r\n*   Oracles\r\n*   Algorithmic stable coins\r\n*   Borrowing/Lending dapps\r\n*   Derivatives\r\n*   Research for open source new financial models (bonding curves)\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nRATIONAL FOR BUDGET DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nTo encourage greater diversity of funded teams and proposals each team can request up to 20% of the total $500,000 USD budget or $100,000 USD.\r\n\r\nE.g.\r\n\r\n*   Team A with 2 proposals of $50,000 USD\r\n*   Team B with 1 proposal of $100,000 USD\r\n*   Team C with 1 proposal of $80,000 USD + 1 proposal of $20,000 US\r\n\r\n\u00a0t is important to note that 20% is the maximum amount of aggregated budget that the same team can request in this challenge, but any amount below that can be requested. This means that the challenge will have space for at least 5 proposals from different teams, which guarantees greater chances for teams with less popularity and that may be overshadowed by more popular teams in the community.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nRATIONAL FOR BUDGET EXPANSION\r\n\r\nThe 500,000 USD budget has been set so that it can accommodate the demand seen in previous Funds for DeFi-related proposals in the \"Scale-UP Cardano''s DeFi Ecosystem\" and \"Dapps & Integrations\" challenges.\u00a0\r\n\r\nDeFi projects tend to involve higher costs than conventional dapps due to the nature of DeFi dapps requiring high levels of assurances, after all they are mission critical applications and the smart contracts of these dApps will guarantee the safety of users and large amounts of money.\r\n\r\nThese development costs puts pressure on teams to break the budget needed into different proposals across multiple Funds. On one hand, budget fragmentation allows the community to assess performance before committing to allocate a large amount of funds, but on the other hand the need to create proposals in consecutive Funds creates friction for the proposers and increases the workload of CAs across multiple Funds. Another negative aspect is that budget fragmentation ends up damming (like water in a dam) the need for funding and causing proposals to actually end up being funded for development that has already been completed, which is a barrier to innovation.\r\n\r\nLooking at the data associated with proposals related to DeFi in Fund5, I noticed that some proposals were submitted in the \"Dapps & Integrations\" challenge. There are some reasons that may justify these proposers choices, such as lack of knowledge about the specific challenge for DeFi (Scale UP Cardano''s DeFi Ecosystem) or the preference for competing in another challenge that could be less competitive, which would also be a problem since the challenge of \"Dapps & Integrations\" has been extremely competitive in the last Funds. Below is an image (Image 2) to illustrate the number of approved proposals and proposals that did not receive funding on the Dapps & Integrations Challenge.\r\n\r\nThe creation of this challenge(Boosting Cardano''s DeFi) can also relieve the pressure for competition in the Dapps & Integrations challenge and make room for dapps that have other use cases besides DeFi.\r\n\r\nTo bring more data to my arguments, I created a chart (Image 3) aggregating the DeFi proposals that were in the \"Scale UP Cardano''s DeFi Ecosystem\" and \"Dapps & Integrations\" challenges. The intention is to demonstrate the demand for dapps directly related to DeFi.\r\n\r\nWhen looking at the DeFi-related proposals that have been approved but not funded, we can see that there are 5 (1 funded by left-over funds , 3 in the Dapps & Integration challenge, and the last in the \"Scale Up Cardano''s DeFi Ecosystem\" challenge). These 5 proposals added together requested around $260,000USD.\r\n\r\nIn the image 4 it is possible to see several dapp projects related to DeFi that are being developed on Cardano (DEXs, Lending+Borrowing, Stable Coins, Synthetic Assets, Oracles, Derivatives and Insurance)", "importance": "It''s important because Defi dApps provide trustless on-demand access to financial services for global users", "goal": "A competitive environment for DeFi on Cardano with an emphasis on cross-collaboration & driving composability across protocols.", "metrics": "*   How many DeFi dapps were launched on Cardano mainnet within 3, 6 and 12 months after funding.\r\n*   How long does each dapp take to be launched.\r\n*   How many daily active users are the DeFi dapps funded in this cohort attracting.\r\n*   How much Total Value Locked (TVL) are the funded DeFi dapps able to capture 3, 6 and 12 months after launch.\r\n*   Number of bugs and vulnerabilities found in each dapp.\r\n*   Amount of resources lost due to bugs or vulnerabilities.\r\n*   Number of users participating in testnets.\r\n*   Number of token holders/unique wallets(when dapp has a token).\r\n*   Distribution of supply between the team and the community.\r\n*   Numbers of listed pairs (in case of DEXs).\r\n*   Number of listed assets (cases of loan+lending dapps, derivatives and synthetic assets).\r\n*   Number of articles and open source financial models research delivered to the community."}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "Cardano received the \"ghostchain\" nickname by many skeptics, despite the number of SPOs, developers in the Plutus Pioneer Program, community engagement in social media, and several other metrics saying otherwise.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMany in our community embraced the term \"ghost\" in a positive way. Some of these \"ghosts\" are extremely dedicated and talented people, but they need and deserve greater reach and support in the community.\r\n\r\nSince Shelley''s launch, one of the issues that has created long and fruitless debates has been about the sustainability and the difficulty of small SPOs raise delegation versus large pool groups (like Binance), SPOs with multi-pools (like 1PCT) and SPOs influencers (I won''t quote them, but you know who they are).\u00a0I want to make it clear that this is all in the rules of the game, but it doesn''t mean that it is good for decentralization.\r\n\r\nWe know that the K parameter and pledge are important for defining the theoretical number of SPOs, but marketing capacity and social outreach distort the playing field, harming and overshadowing small SPOs.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHow can we level the playing field with sustainable, rational and aove all, free market incentives?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, Catalyst has been an amazing funding option for developers in the Cardano community, but the 3-month cycle of each Fund can dampen innovation. Some projects need quick funding sources. Some projects could be funded by the community itself. Not every good proposal fits a challenge. There is demand for alternative funding models, so why not create space for them outside Catalyst?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n++Each team can request up to 25% of the total $100,000 USD budget++\r\n\r\nE.g.\r\n\r\n*   Team A with 2 proposals of $12,500 USD\r\n*   Team B with 5 proposals of $5,000 USD\r\n*   Team C with 1 proposal of $25,000 USD\r\n*   Team D with 1 proposal of $15,000 USD + 1 proposal of $10,000 USD\r\n\r\nDue to the experimental and new nature of the challenge I think it is appropriate to set a relatively low budget ($100,000 USD) but a sufficient amount to address a problem that has been regularly debated in the community and which to date there is no clear solution. The idea of limiting a team to requesting up to 25% of the budget is to allow for a greater diversity of ideas and approaches to solving the problem.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt is important to note that 25% is the maximum, any amount below that can be requested. This means that the challenge will have space for at least 4 proposals from different teams, which guarantees greater chances for teams with less popularity and that may be overshadowed by more popular teams in the community.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nPotential Directions\r\n\r\n*   Marketing teams to promote small SPOs\r\n*   Alternative Reward Models (FISO, NFT aidrops)\r\n*   Crowdfunding and crowdsourcing platforms\r\n*   Creating advanced filters for selecting small SPOs\r\n*   Multi delegation research\r\n*   Explorers and adaptation of wallets to build multi delegation portfolios\r\n\r\nIn this video Sebastien Guillemot( Former co-VP of Engineering at Emurgo and dcSpark CTO and co founder) explains the importance of pools distribution(consensus distribution) to increase reliability and assurances for users and dapps on the blockchain:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwlN3DZvmgQ", "importance": "To achieve greater decentralization and resilience in the blockchain through sustainability/feasibility for small SPOs and devs.", "goal": "Small SPOs and developers have more options, services and tools to get delegates and funding + Greater distribution in block minting.", "metrics": "*   Number of onboarded devs\u00a0outside Catalyst funding\r\n*   Number of onboarded teams outside Catalyst funding\r\n*   Number of pools created\\*\r\n*   Number of delegates over time\\*\r\n*   Number of pools retiring\u00a0over time (0, 3, 6 and 12 months after this challenge)\r\n*   Ratio between retiring pools/total operating pools over time\u00a0(0, 3, 6 and 12 months after this challenge)\r\n*   Percentage of delegation distribution in ALL pools over time (0, 3, 6 and 12 months after funding)\r\n\r\n\\*Metrics should be evaluated for pools benefiting from proposals funded by this challenge"}', -- extra

While a variety of projects push for the adoption of DeFi on Cardano, can we bring to market the potential of DeFi mechanisms as a vehicle for social good?\r\n\r\nDelivering an outcome that has an impact is a lot harder than just delivering a financial Return-on-Investment, even a small one. Impact investing (according to the World Economic Forum) is hindered by:\r\n\r\n*   The lack and/or high cost of trustworthy data on the social or environmental results of investment, making credible accounting of impacts difficult.\r\n*   Challenges around the \"attribution\" of impact \u2013 meaning the allocation of an impact-related claim to an investor risks \"double-counting.\"\r\n*   Roadblocks in monetizing impacts \u2013 illiquid impact markets, uncertain returns, high transaction costs.\r\n\r\nPropose market solutions, financial mechanisms, or means of measuring impact. Think about how these can be deployed at scale to affect positively millions of people. Think about how the results of your proposal can be embedded or reused in different market contexts, or integrated with existing providers.\r\n\r\nIgniting impact investment on Cardano will provide capital to address the world''s most pressing challenges in sectors such as sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, conservation, microfinance, and affordable and accessible basic services including housing, healthcare, and education.\r\n\r\nTo achieve impact requires cooperation and collaboration, something Cardano can enable. Could the answer to better managing the world''s resources lie not in government or big investors but instead in technologies that empower peer-to-peer assistance. Community-based finance or data-driven crowdfunding for instance. How can we leverage the awesome power of the Cardano ecosystem to be that catalyst?\r\n\r\nChallenge Team\r\n\r\nThis proposal can and should be a challenge team proposal. Unfortunately, the proposer''s have not had time to form a challenge team before the proposal goes into review.

    '{"brief": "This challenges aims too support the development of common tools needed for projects to make use of the cardano blockchain.\u00a0\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBriefing\r\n\r\nThere are core functionalities that almost all Dapp projects need like querying the blockchain, managing wallets, creating transactions. These functionalities\u00a0 should be freely available to all and be owned by the community. Some of these solutions are currently only easily available as Software as a Service solution.\u00a0 If most Dapps are build on top of the same proprietary solutions to access the blockchain, however, this leads to centralization and introduces risk.\u00a0\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe goal of Cardano is to also include those who are currently being left out. If the best tools build with the community fund are behind a pay wall this creates an unfair playing field.\u00a0Anyone who wants to start building on top of cardano should be able to easily configure a node with the utilities they need. Anyone who is hosting a node (as SPO or otherwise) should be able to easily add on and offer additional services as they see fit.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nLarge scale projects and singular solutions have proven to be inflexible and the industry is focusing on compositional design. Modern micro service architecture and solutions like containerization allow for common utilities to be developed as self-hosted independent building blocks. This approach allows projects to focus on a single functionality reducing the risk for the whole community.\u00a0\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nGuiding questions:\r\n\r\n How can we ensure future developers benefit from the work that is funded today?\r\n\r\n How do we promote a decentralised\u00a0 and self-hosted ecosystem?\r\n\r\n How do we align between different open source community efforts?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\npossible directions:\r\n\r\n developing common tools as libraries or containerized services\r\n\r\n incentive system for developing & hosting common open source utility''s\r\n\r\n common audited repositories & overviews for open source solutions\r\n\r\n organising events to bring the open source community together\r\n\r\n collaborations/efforts on defining common standards\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe Budget is set to be an additional 10% of the current proposed dev ecosystem challenge.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nChallenge Team:\r\n\r\nDue to time constraints and the short notice a team has not been officially formed. There has been contact with several other community members who have shown an interest. If the Challenge gets accepted a team will be formed and rewards would be shared fairly. The current member has experience with facilitating sessions, writing proposals and has experience working on open source projects as a developer & a product owner.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Challenge team will try to work with existing open source intitiatives too provide proposers a way for proposers to build part of their roadmap. This is ofcourse voluntarry and proposers are free to do their own project within the scope of the challenge.", "importance": "There are core functionalities that most projects need, community owned open-source solutions can make them available to everyone", "goal": "A healthy mix of both private and public groups build on top off, and contribute to, a solid and open foundation for development", "metrics": "Success of this proposal should be measured through the adoption of open source solutions by other projects:\r\n\r\n Usage of open source git repositories\r\n\r\n Usage of open source docker containers\r\n\r\nAt the end of this challenge it should also be easier for developers to find existing tools that help their project.\r\n\r\nHave we managed to create public visible overviews of exisitng open source and free tools?\r\n\r\nOther metrics could involve participating number of devs on open source projects, though this can be hard to track. We can track if events have been organised and seen participation to support open source projects"}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "Africa is fertile ground for the adoption of Cardano.\r\n\r\n\"Having a funding round that focuses on Africa is a win, win, win scenario. Africa wins by getting some backing. Commercial projects that are already building up in Africa win because they get the signal of support from our community. Cardano holders win when there is an encouraging environment for mass adoption anywhere.\r\n\r\nFocussing on Africa is a strategy that has often been promoted and is openly pursued by IOG and Charles Hoskinson\r\n\r\nThe ROI is likely to be high because community sponsored projects are better run in young and developing economies\".\r\n\r\n\u00a0- *Greg Bell & Steve Lockhart* (Fund3 \"Grow Africa, Grow Cardano\" Community Challenge)\r\n\r\nFor projects in Africa to start building on Cardano, the issue of accessibility needs to be addressed.\u00a0\r\n\r\n*   Foremost among them are the basic infrastructure needs that many in the western world take for granted, but are often things that African localities do not commonly have available at a level that will support the development of such a highly technical ecosystem.\u00a0 Electrical supply with UPS integration and backup generators is something that must be secured as local power companies are often subject to brownouts/blackouts.\r\n*   Internet accessibility that will support inter-hub and international cyber-meetings as well as stake-pool operations is something that must be pursued and acquired.\r\n*   In addition to those basic needs are also the hardware required to support developers, teachers, students and the associated community outreach each hub is planning.\r\n\r\nHow this challenge addresses the problem\r\n\r\nThe issue of access is already a well articulated problem. African Governments and private entities like World Mobile are hard at work building infrastructure.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis challenge will therefore look for local implementors to acquire, equip and resource local community centres/hubs where communities can be mobilized to solve problems on Cardano", "importance": "Without support, electricity and internet accessibility challenges will hamstring Cardano''s overall potential and goal to bank the unbanked", "goal": "Create well resourced Community Centres in African countries where communities solve local problems on Cardano & expand Cardano''s market", "metrics": "The issue of infrastructure being a limitation in grassroots Africa accessing the potential of Cardano and DLT in general is no secret.\u00a0\r\n\r\nWill this challenge,\r\n\r\n1.  Provide a springboard for Cardano adoption?\r\n2.  Advance Cardano''s mission?\r\n3.  Engage the Cardano Community?\r\n\r\nYes, we believe so!\r\n\r\n++The on the ground metrics to ensure this challenge is delivered on++\r\n\r\n*   Number of hubs/community centres with back-up and stable power supply with high-speed internet access, designed to maintain a stake pool operation\r\n*   Number of hubs/community centres with space and equipment for classes and work\r\n*   Number of new community members onboarded (e.g. devs, enterprises, thought leaders etc.)\r\n\r\n++Rationale for Budget++\r\n\r\nThis challenge anticipates an average budget of $30k space, equipment and operating costs annually in 10 locations per funding round."}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "Currently it is assumed that all Challenges follow the same system, which is Catalyst as we know it, defined by its current interfaces, rules and parameters. This makes the whole of catalyst an experiment for this specific system. Preferably their would be a way to create controlled experiments to try out several different systems, in a comparable manner.\u00a0\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of ideas and proposals which aim too introduce changes to the system, related to voting, assessments, the proposal system, and so on. The question is how can they be adopted into the system? If there is only one system governing all funds, changing it comes with a lot of risk. If instead some Challenges use their own system, they can serve as isolated experiments.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nProposals in the Challenge Setting category could introduce changes within their scope by including them in the challenge description. Some changes might be easier to implement than others and some might require entire side chain solutions. Currently the responsibility to deliver these solutions lies with the Catalyst team. This Challenge aims too support initiatives that make these kind of changes possible and to start taking ownership as a community over this part of the infrastructure.\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nGuiding Questions:\r\n\r\n Which proposals would allow alternative systems to be used within Catalyst\r\n\r\n Which proposals provide a technical bridge between Ideascale, Cardano mainnet & Yormungander and community tools\r\n\r\n Which initiatives provide support for challenge teams\u00a0\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nExample directions:\r\n\r\n Design alternative models & frameworks for Challenges\r\n\r\n develop models/Tools/Smart contracts to facilitate Challenge specific CA''s, voting, fund distribution\r\n\r\n Organising challenge specific groups (experts, mentors, auditors)\r\n\r\n Develop platforms for everyone participating in a challenge to connect & share\r\n\r\n integrations with Ideascale and other Catalyst systems\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSuccess of this challenge would see outcomes from the proposals being incorporated by Challenge Setting proposers and Challenge Teams. Such adoptions can be seen as a means of validation of the quality of the outcomes. In turn, systems that proof to work when they are used in a challenge can naturally lead too adoption by other challenge proposers.\u00a0\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBudget reasoning:\r\n\r\nThe challenge focusses on improving the internal governance systems. If we assume a 5-10% budget on improving the governance, this budget fills a recent portion of it, while leaving room for\u00a0 some other challenges.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nTo provide an example of altering the rules for a challenge, the following changes are proposed to be included for the scope of this challenge:\r\n\r\nFund Allocation based on voting:\r\n\r\n *Remaining funds must match >= 90% of proposed funds or else a proposal is skipped (as opposed to 100%)*\r\n\r\nReasoning for the rule: If a proposal receives at least 90% of it''s proposed budget, it should be able to deliver on it''s intial goals. Although this is not a perfect solution, this should lead to less", "importance": "With proper guidance, tools and research each challenge can become a small self-contained experiment on the road towards Voltaire", "goal": "A diverse pool of sophisticated and effective Challenges tailored to their goals making full use of the technologies they enable", "metrics": "Metrics in this should be measured through the adoption of the outcomes\u00a0 in other challenges:\r\n\r\nChallenges using developed systems & tools for: proposing, assessing, voting, fund distribution or auditing\r\n\r\nCollaborations between tool builder & challenge teams\r\n\r\nCommunity tools that have been integrated into the Catalyst process"}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "As in Africa, raising the awareness levels of regular people in East Asia about blockchain and the Cardano network should be a priority for the Catalyst community. In this challenge, we provide funding for people who have learned about Cardano to take advantage of the community''s support and build on or use the Cardano network.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the proposals for this challenge is open-ended. Their only requirement is to originate or focus on East Asia and include east Asian team members or focus on East Asian participants.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the overwhelming majority of Stake Pools reside in North America and Europe. The Cardano network will be more resilient when Stake Pools are evenly distributed across the globe. The Catalyst community needs to step up and intentionally make that happen.\r\n\r\nCardano started life in East Asia (Japan and Hong Kong), and Emurgo focuses on East Asia. Let''s build upon that.\r\n\r\nWhat this is:\r\n\r\nA call to action; Activate the Cardano community''s ability to recognise, reward the opportunity to make the world a better place. East Asia is fertile ground for the adoption of Cardano. The return on intention (ROI) is likely to be high because projects in young and developing economies face less economic inertia.\r\n\r\nAddressing different parts of the world directly and intentionally through funding challenges makes our community more accessible. It makes us more resilient. It helps us learn and understand the needs of communities that make up our ecosystem.\r\n\r\nIt is a vision that needs votes to become an achievement. When the challenge succeeds, the beneficiary is the whole Cardano community. It is a call to close our prejudices and open our eyes, hearts and minds to good people who lack the benefits many of us were born with\u2014allowing others with fewer privileged circumstances to rise and succeed.\u00a0  \r\n\r\nChallenge Team\r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks to include a challenge team. Unfortunately, the proposer''s have not had time to fully form a challenge team before the proposal goes into review. If possible, we intend to help form that team before voting commences.\r\n\r\nThe following individuals have offered to be on the challenge team.\r\n\r\nFelix Weber (@felixweber)\r\n\r\nRobert O''Brien (@wolstaeb)\r\n\r\nThe role of Challenge Teams is to steward the challenges in Catalyst - to present the challenge, track the progress, and report back to the community their perspective on whether the challenges were addressed.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in being part of that team, please let us know in the comments.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n\r\nThis proposal is a copy of the Grow Africa, Grow Cardano proposed by @grebel and @archangelbob and is now one of the many Catalyst Challenges.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: TRANSLATIONS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE AVAILABLE ON THE EASTERN TOWNHALL WEBSITE:\r\n\r\nhttps://c3eth.github.io/catalyst/fund6/eth-proposals/grow-east-asia-grow-cardano/", "importance": "The Cardano community leans heavily toward North America and Europe. Growth elsewhere requires our support and initiative as a community.", "goal": "A broad spectrum of people across Asia and connected to Asia, coming together and forming teams to grow our ecosystem.", "metrics": "At the end of this challenge, we will be asking ourselves some questions about the quality of participation:  \r\n\r\n*   The number of proposals originating from East Asian participants in Project Catalyst\r\n*   The quantity and quality of funded proposals originating from East Asian teams.\r\n*   The observed impact of funded projects (meeting their KPIs).\r\n*   Did we increase the participation of the Cardano community and Catalyst teams with East Asian residents?\r\n*   Was there an increase in Daily/Monthly Active Wallets (DAW/MAW) as a proxy measure of momentum and engagement\r\n*   Did we increase the number of Stake Pools and Stake Pool Operators based in East Asia?\r\n\r\nWe will also be asking some specific questions about the quality of the proposals:  \r\n\r\n*   Is there good feedback on funded project progress, failure or success, that help us understand the nuances of deploying Cardano solutions across East Asia?\r\n*   What is the novelty and appropriateness of solutions?\r\n*   Are we on track to improve the lives of people using Cardano in East Asia?\r\n*   Was social and environmental impact evaluation used to measure proposal performance?\r\n*   What is the sustainability of proposals beyond the scope of Catalyst?"}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "In a proof of stake system with distributed governance a common understanding of truth and reliance on authentic sources of correct and provable information can be crucial for avoiding a splitting of the community into two or more feuding camps.\r\n\r\nA distributed denial-of-truth (DDoT) attack could be defined as a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal operations of a community, service or network by overwhelming the target, its surrounding infrastructure and community with a flood of disinformation and malinformation.\r\n\r\nDisinformation is fabricated or deliberately manipulated audio/visual/text content, intentionally created conspiracy theories or rumors or to sow mistrust.\u00a0With disinformation the bad information is spread with the intent to deceive.\r\n\r\nMalinformation is the deliberate publication of information for personal or corporate rather than public interest. Deliberate change of context, date or time of genuine content.\r\n\r\nThese DDoT attack scenarios may emerge as a combined outside/inside attack and spread faster in fiercely tribal communities, such as a cryptocurrency community. A DDoT attack might overwhelm a system with false information, leading to a plunge in confidence / community split.\r\n\r\n\"Right now everybody is implicitly assuming that the only possible victim is an election,\" says David Perlman, a former Twitter Inc. data scientist who is now developing ways for corporations to counter disinformation at the computer security company Leviathan Security Group Inc. \"There''s no reason that a company couldn''t be a victim,\" he says.\\*\u00a0\r\n\r\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/brands-face-a-new-online-threat-disinformation-attacks-11602187365\r\n\r\nA bad faith player may secretly prepare for this scenario out of particular interests that are not publicly visible initially. This can be done with the help of some major holders/exchanges/rival coins/investors and/or media personalities.\r\n\r\nWe are all aware how a single person (Elon Musk) is already able to move crypto markets, while a handful of prominent Cardano personas with outside support might be able to do the same.\r\n\r\nProposers in this challenge would focus on improving the transparency of all segments of Cardano treasury monetary transfers and make \"beginner-friendly\" tutorials on how to monitor financial events from the very inception of Cardano and its main founding entities.\u00a0\r\n\r\nProposers would also focus on shining a powerful light on old and new attempts to game the system, further scams, fleece users, sow distrust, spread lies and destabilize the community.\r\n\r\nMany possible DDoT scenarios may evolve if the Cardano community is not proactively working to prevent them.\u00a0\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOne invented - example DDoT scenario to illustrate how things can go wrong fast:\u00a0\r\n\r\nExample scenario involving bad faith: A former/current head or founder or leading researcher/manager of one of the three founding entities of Cardano issues an untrue statement questioning the legitimacy of efforts/intentions of another founding entity or possible financial shenanigans.\r\n\r\nSeveral prominent community SPOs side with the accusing entity, as do several leading Youtube influencers and crypto media. Other side with the accused side. Some companies start distancing themselves.\r\n\r\nRumors circulate that one founding entity allegedly secretly siphoned funds and that has been done behind the scenes. Another rumor circulates that one of the Cardano entities has installed a backdoor and several SPOs announce they have reduced their pledges out of fear. Panic spreads. The allegations are amplified through social media.\r\n\r\nTruth is hard to establish - references are made to talks and private discussions, public allegations are difficult to verify.\r\n\r\nThe general community has no way to verify the true merits of the claims - as they are undocumented. Two camps emerge. Cardano community splits along fault lines. This adds more fuel to the fire. ADA value plunges. The very sources of truth in the Cardano ecosystem come under question. The entire system teeters. A DDOT attack by a group of two dozen well organized distributed players is underway. Governance is rocked.\r\n\r\n\\===\r\n\r\n\\[Reminder: One of the three founding entities has previously been led by a person who was widely seen as pursuing particular interests ahead of the common good.\\] \"Following the resignation, Hoskinson said: \"Now that Parsons is gone, the Foundation needs to work very hard to restore its trust, faith, and credibility within the Cardano community\u2026\"\\] This shows that even such an example scenario is not fully implausible.\u00a0\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nhttps://www.cbinsights.com/research/future-of-information-warfare/\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nImportant note: This is a Fund6 Challenge Setting proposal - for a future challenge in Fund 7. This means I am not personally applying for funding in this challenge!\r\n\r\nThe proposed budget of this proposal will serve to fund multiple proposals developed by future proposers in Fund 7 who would apply to find solutions to this challenge.\r\n\r\nI have no proposed solutions nor am I suggesting the best way of addressing this Challenge it will be up to proposers in Fund 7, if voters select this as a future Challenge.", "importance": "Legacy systems have been brought to the brink by the inability of stakeholders, participants and the public to agree on what is truth.", "goal": "Truth about Cardano and ongoing and past events is easy to establish even for newcomers.

    '{"brief": "INTRODUCTION:\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFounded in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood, IOHK (now IOG) is a world-class engineering and technology company committed to using peer-to-peer innovations to provide financial services to billions of people that don''t have them. The group was contracted to design, build, and maintain Cardano through to 2020.\r\n\r\nIOG CEO Charles Hoskinson\u00a0recently outlined a major, ambitious vision for shaping up a long-term roadmap pushing Cardano towards 2025.\r\n\r\nSome elements of the vision include first completing Ouroboros Omega (which will be available by end of 2021), as a capstone of research. Elements that will be explored are fast finality, sidechains, no reliance on external clocks, the ability to gracefully recover from 51% attacks, plus a little faster TPS.\r\n\r\nThe 2025 agenda will includes reaching Ouroboros Omega++.\r\n\r\nAnother part of the roadmap is Light Clients (such as Yoroi) which are easy to do with trust assumptions (someone running a server that is a window into the system). There are other protocols on the market such as MINA that uses recursive SNARKs that proof that the coins exist and have not been spent - even without having a copy of the blockchain.\r\n\r\nIOG''s paper on the Mithral Protocol is expected to come out by end of 2021 and possibly a prototype, with the idea of creating a similar trust model that would allow a light client by default.\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor a sidechains model and layer 2 infrastructure, IOG is exploring adding sidechains support for EVM, IELE, Catalyst, etc. via a community approved hard-fork combinator event following a Cardano Improvement Proposal.\u00a0\r\n\r\nPrism and DID embedding is also in the pipeline for authenticated wallets and regulated DeFi spaces, permissioned for access with certain credentials and leading to Human Readable Addresses.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAnother piece of off-chain infrastructure is Hydra, based on a four paper agenda (two finished, two to be finished by end of 2021). Hydra is a craft-on layer two solution that SPOs will be able to add on. With you have a Cardano DApp you will be able to use Prism for free, as well as using Hydra.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOther elements mentioned in scope for 2025 include: quantum resistance, zero-knowledge crypto, quantum resistance with the signature scheme, how to use quantum computers to enhance Cardano, modelling quantum adversaries - a big Quantum agenda.\u00a0\r\n\r\nOn the governance side, a lot of work will be done to link Catalyst (concerned with Treasury) with Voltaire (concerned with Protocol updates). The unification will start in 2021, extending and finishing in 2022. The governance system will probably be a bicameral voting model with feedback, expert ballots, correct economics.\r\n\r\nIn a April 5 2021 video, Hoskinson stated that IOG''s aim is to overbuild the governance stuff in Catalyst and Voltaire by adding other voting systems, such as preference voting, quadratic voting, all of which will be available for use in DApps.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIOG will also launch a research agenda to move from a plutocratic model (right now) to a hybrid model (ADA + Proof of Merit). This segment is closer to the 2025 part of the 2021-25 research agenda. The idea is to use different resources inside the system, as people build identity and reputation inside the system.\u00a0\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nCHALLENGE BRIEF:\r\n\r\nAs Cardano is a decentralized project and community, the IOG-proposed roadmap is clearly a major contribution for the ecosystem - but it does not eliminate the possibility of alternative and complementary visions. The roadmap that is expected later this year - will also serve as a foundational platform for many more complementary projects, visions, teams and strategies that can start building upon its vision.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe brief for this Challenge is to propose new mechanisms, platforms, teams and tools for development (or the expansion of existing\u00a0mechanisms, platforms, teams and tools) to start working on creating community-based ideas for the Cardano 2025 roadmap.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe future development of Cardano is being planned and decided soon and the community needs to step up and participate.\u00a0\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\u00a0Important note: This is a Fund6 Challenge Setting proposal - for a future challenge in Fund 7. This means I am not personally applying for funding in this challenge!\r\n\r\nThe proposed budget of this proposal will serve to fund multiple proposals developed by future proposers in Fund 7 who would apply to find solutions to this challenge.\r\n\r\nI have no proposed solutions nor am I suggesting the best way of addressing this Challenge it will be up to proposers in Fund 7, if voters select this as a future Challenge.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRYRjmMvkJM&t=1389s", "importance": "Developing alternative and complementary community visions of Cardano''s future will help expand scope and impact of IOG''s roadmap for 2025", "goal": "The Cardano community creates novel roadmaps for 2025, inspiring new teams to build, deliver, expand and implement projects", "metrics": " number or roadmaps or elements or visions for 2025 that are proposed\r\n\r\n number of teams & groups proposing detailed plans (with budgets) for development by 2025\r\n\r\n quality and detail of proposals which should include plans for action and financing\r\n\r\n number of ideas that are able to integrate or complement with IOG''s roadmap for 2025\r\n\r\n number of ideas that are financed and are outside of IOG''s 2025 roadmap, but will still improve the Cardano system  \r\n number of proposers, teams implementing ideas from the alternative roadmaps\r\n\r\n number of proposals that also envisage obtaining financing from one of the three founding entities of Cardano and/or Project Catalyst"}', -- extra
