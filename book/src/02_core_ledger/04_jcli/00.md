# jcli

This is the node command line helper. It is mostly meant for developers and
stake pool operators. It allows offline operations:

* generating cryptographic materials for the wallets and stake pools;
* creating addresses, transactions and certificates;
* prepare a new blockchain

and it allows simple interactions with the node:

* query stats;
* send transactions and certificates;
* get raw blocks and UTxOs.
