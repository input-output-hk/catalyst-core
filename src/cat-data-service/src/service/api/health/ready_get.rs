/// # GET /health/ready
///
/// Readiness endpoint.
///
/// Kubernetes (and others) use this endpoint to determine if the service is
/// able to service requests.
///
/// In this service, readiness is guaranteed if this endpoint is reachable.
/// So, it will always just return 204.
///
/// In theory it can also return 503 if for some reason a temporary circumstance
/// is preventing this service from properly serving request.
///
/// An example could be the service has started a long and cpu intensive task
/// and is not able to properly service requests while it is occurring.
/// This would let the load balancer shift traffic to other instances of this
/// service that are ready.
///
/// ## Responses
///
/// * 204 No Content - Service is Ready to serve requests.
/// * 500 Server Error - If anything within this function fails unexpectedly. (Possible but unlikely)
/// * 503 Service Unavailable - Service is not ready, do not send other requests.
