# If necessary, you can exclude one or more links from being checked with a
# list of regular expressions. The regex will be applied to the link href (i.e.
# the `./index.html` in `[some page](./index.html)`) so it can be used to
# ignore both web and filesystem links.

# Hint: you can use TOML's raw strings (single quote) to avoid needing to

# How should warnings be treated?
#
# - "warn" will emit warning messages
# - "error" treats all warnings as errors, failing the linkcheck
# - "ignore" will ignore warnings, suppressing diagnostic messages and allowing
#   the linkcheck to continuing
# We do NOT allow broken links in CI, but only warn in development.
# DO NOT EDIT THIS SETTING OR YOu WILL BREAK CI.

# in order to link check to succeed.
#

# matching a set of web sites, and values being an array of
# the headers.
#[output.linkcheck.http-headers]
# Any hyperlink that contains this regexp will be sent
# the "Accept: text/html" header
#'crates\.io' = ["Accept: text/html"]

# mdbook-linkcheck will interpolate environment variables into your header via
# $IDENT.
#
# If this is not what you want you must escape the `$` symbol, like `\$TOKEN`.
# `\` itself can also be escaped via `\\`.
#
# Note: If interpolation fails, the header will be skipped and the failure will
# be logged. This can be useful if a particular header isn't always necessary,
# but may be helpful (e.g. when working with rate limiting).
