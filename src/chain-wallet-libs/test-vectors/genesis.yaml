  # by default it is send to the "rewards" pot of the epoch which is then
  # distributed to the different stake pools who created blocks that given

  #
  # There's fundamentally many potential choices for how rewards are contributed back, and here's two potential valid examples:
  #
  # Linear formula: constant - ratio * (#epoch after epoch_start / epoch_rate)
  # Halving formula: constant * ratio ^ (#epoch after epoch_start / epoch_rate)
  #
  reward_parameters:
    halving: # or use "linear" for the linear formula
      # In the linear formula, it represents the starting point of the contribution
      # at #epoch=0, whereas in halving formula is used as starting constant for
      # the calculation.
      constant: 100

      # In the halving formula, an effective value between 0.0 to 1.0 indicates a
      # reducing contribution, whereas above 1.0 it indicate an acceleration of contribution.
      #
      # However in linear formula the meaning is just a scaling factor for the epoch zone
      # (current_epoch - start_epoch / epoch_rate). Further requirement is that this ratio
      # is expressed in fractional form (e.g. 1/2), which allow calculation in integer form.
      ratio: '13/19'

      # indicates when this contribution start. note that if the epoch is not
      # the same or after the epoch_start, the overall contribution is zero.
      epoch_start: 1

      # the rate at which the contribution is tweaked related to epoch.
