It has two internal long running tasks.
Read, validate and record latest registrations/delegations from the linked block chain.
Read and record running total balance and unclaimed rewards for every stake address.
It also exposes a Voting Power API.
Get voting power for Stake Address or Voting Key as at (timestamp).  Would respect the registrations valid at that time.
So if you asked for your voting power but you were delegated,
the API would return you have X personal voting power,
and Y..Z Voting power of yours has been delegated to Keys A-B.
Options:
Max Registration Age (So regitrations before this date/time are not considered).
Must have valid payment address.
(So we can later make a valid payment address a necessity if required, and this would also exclude just using stake address.)
Voting power calculation type
Absolute on the time of snapshot
Average Maximum daily value
Parameter: Length of time to average over (in days).
Voting power linearity
Linear (1 ADA = X voting power).  Where X is a parameter.
Logarithmic (Voting power is attenuated by a logarithmic function).  Would need parameters to define the curve.
Other??
Get Registration/Delegation information for a Stake Address/Voting Key as at a time.  Similar to above but does NOT do any
Get all active registrations as at a time.
Time and max age of registrations are parameters.
If stake addresses without registration are included in the output.
