# Implementation Plan

The system is being written from scratch but will incorporate as many off-the-shelf libraries as possible.

## Key Libraries

* [TxPipe] blockchaan libraries
  * [Oura] - Example implementation of a chain follower.
  * [Pallas] - Building Blocks for communicating with the blockchain and interpreting transactions.

* Database Storage
  * [SurrealDB] - In-Memory/Local and Server backed Database Engine with native rust bindings.
