        Check if a Ballot is correctly formatted and signed.
        This endpoint is to check all possible aspects of an individual ballot and return a report details what is correct, and what is incorrect.
        The actual format of the report is TBD on implementation.
        It is to handle both Private and Public Ballots.

        If Event ID is provided, the ballot should also be checked against current knowledge of the Events Objectives and Proposals to check the contents of the ballot are correct.  Otherwise, they are not considered and ONLY the raw format is checked.

        It must also check the Ballot is signed properly with the voters private voting key.

        If an event is supplied, it should also check if the Voting Key is registered and eligible to vote on the event.
        If no event is supplied, it should check if the "latest" snapshot contains a registration for this voting key.  If it does not, this is not an Error, but a warning status should be returned.
