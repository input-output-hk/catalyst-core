//! Extra types defined in postgres

//! db-sync defines a few types in postgres. When diesel generates a schema, it uses these types,
//! but since they don't exist on the Rust side, type checking fails. So we provide them in this
//! module
//!
//! Many types here have slightly wonky capitalization, but that's just what diesel expects
