## Requirements

TODO:

## Development

## Prerequisites

### Development Environment (NIX Shell)

This is the **preferred** development environment.

1. Install NIX : <https://nixos.org/download.html>
2. Start a nix development environment (From the repo Root):
   `nix develop`

### Development Environment (Manual)

~~ ***NOT RECOMMENDED*** ~~

TODO...

### Install Extra Packages/Tools

This only needs to be done once when the development environment is created.

1. `cargo install cargo-binstall --locked` : see <https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall>
2. `cargo binstall --no-confirm cargo-make` : see <https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make>
3. `cargo make install-prereqs`

TODO: Can this (or an equivalent) be done by the devshell?

## Testing

TODO:

## Deployment

TODO:

## Building Documentation

If you have edited any of the documentation, then it needs to be updated by running:

```sh
cargo make build-docs
```

Any update files need to be committed to the repo. (until we have this integrated with CI).
