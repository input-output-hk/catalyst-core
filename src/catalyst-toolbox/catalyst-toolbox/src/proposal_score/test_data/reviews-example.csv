Algorithms are mentioned as the way they deal with the scoring of profiles against different variables. Finally the $MAIN token and DAO are detailed which outlines how the token focusses on driving how data is prioritised from these platforms as there is such a vast amount of data to collect. The token also helps with governing priorities of the ecosystem. The tokenomics could have had a bit more detail as it is difficult to fully understand whether it will be easy to create right incentives for the token holders to influence the platform to collect the data which is most valuable to the holders. As a comparison it could have been good to understand what kind of value users of this system put on this application - in a web 2 setting what would they pay for this monthly in a subscription to have access to this information? How does that translate into the tokenomics of this application? Is this a service that people want to pay someone else to do to get the information or is it something that people want to actively participate in themselves?

In terms of cost breakdown the proposal has broken down how the budget will be spent based on the functional areas such as backend, frontend, smart contracts and marketing efforts. The itemised list provides sufficient depth and clarity on exact intentions. The team is listed with their skill sets and all have professional profiles attached. The team has a diversity of skill sets and has already showcased they are able to execute the previous work. They do not have a Plutus/Haskell developer internal to the team which increases the risk on the delivery or quality of execution for this key area. Due to the depth of information provided, detailed breakdown and evidence of previous delivery and teams background a higher confidence is given that the team will be able to effectively secure the haskell developer needed and feasibly execute the intentions of the proposal.",5,"For tracking the proposals progress the team mention outcome based metrics for the usage of the applicaiton. It would have been good for the team to share how they intend to share progress with the community such as through Github repository commits, progress reports or video updates so that community can more easily engage in the execution of this proposal and provide feedback. It would have also been nice to share any intentions to open source certain efforts from the proposal that would benefit the community or intentions to do so. Success for the proposal gave a high level goal of having community members participate and be rewarded by earning in the ecosystem being developed. It would have been been good to have more specific objectives for the application to showcase that the team fully understands what they are trying to achieve with this specific funding so that the community can more effectively determine whether impact have in fact been delivered.

This proposal is attempting to do exactly that, spread the word about what is being build on Cardano EVM architecture. Love the idea! 

The proposal does a great job speaking to the specific asks of the challenge. It falls short of a five stars because of the lack of specific solution nouns. it is clear what the proposal wants to do, it's not as clear where and how it plans to do it. 

Some specific questions that comes to mind are what is an ""outreach incursion?"" 
What influencers will be targeted? Youtubers? tweetter? Redditers? ethCorner.eth accounts? 

What is a ""strategic content""? Infographics? How to manuals? blog posts? youtube or snapshot shorts? These specific missing nouns has a high impact, pun intended, on the reach and influence of the work being proposed. ",4,"The proposal has a detail writeup of milestones spanning six months with breakdowns of deliverable for each month. The budget is pretty simple, two, humans, each with a fixed amount each month who will be working together to get this done. This is a little surprising since the proposal expects to engage with influencers... should there be a marketing line item? Are there any costs associated with hosting the articles? Medium subscription? Website launch? Even if these missing items are free, a five star proposal would itemize them and communicate that to the voter, speaks well to the team's organization and management skills, a big factor on ability to deliver. ",4,"The proposal does a great job proposing a way for the community to track the work (gitbook, dework, and treasury guild). Would have love to also see instructions for how the community can audit the outcomes of the work. Do we follow a social media account and expect posting when each article is release? Do we follow a medium profile? Bookmark a website? How and where would we go to see the articles?",4

Many people are involved in 3d printing and manufacturing who may not be involved with blockchain, and this is a great way to bring new people into Cardano. This concept could scale up to have a much larger impact in the future. Funding this early stage startup would be a great way to kickstart a global Decentralized Manufacturing Marketplace on Cardano. ",5,The team consists of Cardano community builders that have been with Cardano since the beginning. They have delivered various successful projects on Cardano and are highly likely to be successful with this endeavour. The budget is broken down into 5 specific deliverables. No additional funding will be required from Catalyst to complete this proposal. The timetable includes specific deliverables (additional features)  to be completed in a 4 month timeframe.  This proposal is rated 5 out of 5 for feasibility because it very likely that the deliverables will be delivered on time and on budget. ,5,"This proposal has clear and quantifiable deliverables and ""the following features will be added to the core of the marketplace functionality:
Profiles for Operators
Fully Automated Shipping Integration
Guild Networks
The ability to sell/transfer rights for a manufacturing file.
Management/Priority Queueing, to ensure fair distribution of in demand jobs.""

Cardanopress is a WordPress plugin that provides a plug and plays features for WordPress developers to exploit web3 features. A few of the features being supported by the plugin are allowing for reading wallet data, performing transactions and stake pool delegation. The Github repository has five forks and active development. The current proposal is for creating more details instructions on how to implement all the features and various use cases. There is definitely a need for documentation with example projects. This will jump-start the use of the repository and lower the entry knowledge level required for the developer. WordPress is normally used by many entry-level programmers with limited experience in WordPress. It is normally said that documentation is the weakness in many open source projects, therefore there is a need to develop the documentation in terms of the video guide of this useful project to unlock its true potential. Therefore the proposal is in alignment with the challenge.",5,The proposal is from the team which has developed the plugin to write documentation and provide hands-on examples to improve the usability of the plugin. This is not likely to be a challenge. The team which has developed the software will surely be able to build documentation. The proposal is to take community feedback and produce videos which will guide the developers. The proposers are maintaining the software in a good state and i believe they should be able to perform this task successfully. ,5,The proposal bids $9K for 60 hours of content development at the rate of $150 USD per hour. This rate seems to be on the higher side. The proposal also includes 16 hours of video production. Even with this the rates are bit higher. The proposal has a clear outline and what exactly will be produced is likely to be finalised after receiving community feedback. Hoewver teh output is fairly clear and the progress can be easily monitored and audited since the complete output will be in open domain. ,4

This proposal is a continuation of a series of proposals submitted in previous funds that have been selected for funding allocation. In order to enhance the end user experience, the team is adding key features to the solution under construction, which is expected to enhance the possibility of exponential market adoption. It is an excellent use case within the ecosystem, allowing commercialization through a 3D printable NFT marketplace, while maintaining the designer's copyright. In the proposal description, it is possible to see the existing relationship to the challenge setting and it is relevant in terms of explaining what the problem is and how the proposed solution solves it. While it is understood that the successful implementation of this solution would positively impact Cardano's NFT market transactions, I would have liked to find information about the market they expect to capture when this solution is released.  
",5,"This proposal is the result of a team that brings together people with experience in all relevant areas. Additionally, many of them are part of teams that have delivered products or services to the Cardano and SPOs ecosystem. It was structured based on the features they wish to add to the solution, which can be viewed as work packages to which a percentage of the total amount requested was assigned. While in this manner it is possible to understand in a simple manner what the company intends to build, in order for a deeper evaluation to be conducted it is necessary to provide detailed information. No reference has been made to the number of hours of development or specific skills required.  ",4,"Despite the fact that these features are not milestones strictly speaking, I would view them as such. However, It would have been more helpful if the roadmap had provided a more detailed description. Despite the fact that these features are only expected to be completed within four months, given that Adosia has proposals that were allocated budgets in previous funds, as well as an additional one in this fund, I would have expected a greater level of transparency in that area. Regarding reporting and communications with the community, although the monthly report to Catalyst is mentioned, there is no mention of communication channels with the community. For success metrics, they can be summarized as ""all features will be available in the solution in 4 months""; however, for a project of this size, I would have expected an estimation of the impact goals they expect to reach as a business, such as earning XX$ in XX months or achieving XX sales per month.

Given that the majority of websites are built on wordpress, this represents a huge opportunity to onboard new developers and users. As someone familiar with the ease of using wordpress plugins, I'm excited by the possibilities this offers to accelerate mainstream use and adoption of cardano wallets for ecommerce. I also have some experience building dapps, and enabling wallet connections was a major challenge. Allowing devs to unlock that capability with a configurable plugin is massively powerful.    ",5,"As someone with experience managing delivery of complex technical projects, the timeline seems overly optimistic. However, the proposal mentions that core development is mostly complete, which should help to drastically accelerate things, making the timeline more believable. Having actual beta users already helps to validate both the technical and commercial viability of the solution. The proposers add credibility by including links to linkedin and github.

They may have been referring to the phases outlined in the feasibility section, but even then, I would have liked to see clear stage gates for progressing across phases in the interest of auditability.

Live streaming is now a popular form with a large transaction volume in all online commerce items. Live stream programs also easily attract a large number of communities. Therefore, I believe this project, if implemented, will attract more people to cardano, especially new artists and users who were previously less interested in the blockchain field.
Live streaming of art products also helps to better verify product identity, ensuring real goods reach buyers. Therefore, this project is in line with the direction that this challenge offers.",5,"The project will implement the plan into two phases (BETA of website and CNFT implementation). They have detailed each task and the order of implementation, so this plan is clear enough for us to track progress. However, they need to attach a timeline for each working period by week/month, which is better.
Regarding the proposed budget, I agree with basically the expenses they applied for. However, they need more detailed activities on project management, marketing... to see specifically who is in charge, what is the job, and how much time is needed for it. That will be enough to convince the community to vote for your project.
About the personal profiles of the members here it is really unclear because you have only mentioned the names and roles of 5 people without the link to each person's profile and photos as well as their work experience. This is a pretty big weakness.",3,"Because the work plan above they do not have a deadline for each work phase, it is quite difficult to track the project progress. I hope they will add this information in more detail. They will report this progress through github, JIKA - I believe these tools are enough to see project transparency about project progress. However, they need to specify the parameters to report to the community. For example, the number of website visits, the number of purchase and sale transactions on the website, the number of published and purchased works...
Finally, since this is a project related to works of art, they need to have a communication plan for users and artists. I hope they can refer to previous successful projects for better proposals, as this concept project is very encouraging.",4

Both proposers have primarily skills and experiences around digital marketing and media.  Given the migration problem from EVM chains to Cardano is more of a technical one, just marketing material might not be enough to be a needle mover for the requested amount of funds in this proposal.  If there was a more technical developer who had EVM-experience and skills to guide the team it would have much more appeal and chances of making a larger impact.  SEO and CTA content although nice (especially in multiple languages) is still not quite enough to be meaningful enough.",2,The team has a lot of experience in digital marketing and media and would likely be able to deliver this proposal successfully.

This will help the developer ecosystem by lowering the technical barrier for non-developers to be able to create their own platforms and projects. 

The team commits to creating supporting documentation that will walk non-technical users through a step-by-step instruction of how to build a site. The replication of the WordPress approach will not only appeal to groups using this already, it will allow new users to easily learn the necessary components. 

As a non-technical person myself, I am happy to see projects that cater to not only existing developers but also would-be ones too. By supporting individuals to develop their solutions themselves, with the assistance of the CardanoPress.io platform, the technology and access to it will be further decentralized. ",5,"Yes, given the experience and plan presented, it is very likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. 

A strong indicator for feasibility is that the team has already developed their CardanoPress.io website that provides access to the tools and plugins this project will support. Given that these are already in operation that is little doubt whether the platform itself is feasible. This is where this specific proposal picks up by taking what is already available but breaking it down even further into step-by-step instructions. This doesn't appear that it would be overly difficult since it reflect what already exists. 

I do think that the plan could have been elaborated a bit further. While I appreciate that the proposer has broken the plan into five phases, there are no real explanations of the activities or deliverables. Specifically, I would have liked to see a list of topics which the documentation will cover, and how many different documents will be created. They also plan to engage the community to validate the writing but who will you engage, and how? 

This same comment goes for the budget. While high level categories are fine, without some details we really have no idea what to expect. For example, how many videos will be created? How long will each video take? What happens if they reach 16 hours and are not done the videos? Will it just stop? These types of gaps in the plan that would need to be addressed to get full marks. ",4,"Yes, the information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and success of the proposal. 

In the process of creating the documentation, the team commits to engaging the community to input to the documents and test them out through implementation. I definitely welcome this outright commitment as it implies the team is open to feedback and criticism. 

The commitment to also list all the documentation online and made available to everyone is also a good approach as it is likely that as anomalies come up the team will be able to receive ongoing feedback, keeping the documents iterative and evergreen. This means that as new advances are made, the team can integrate them into their existing documentation. 

What I think could use more consideration here are the success measures. It is good that the team will use use of the documentation and traffic to the site as KPIs but without thresholds of success it is difficult to know when it would be deemed a success vs. failure. Having ""more projects"" installing CardanoPress as the base of development is good, but how many projects would be deemed successful? Making these goals more tangible and measurable would certainly strengthen this section. 

Overall great proposal and best of luck in the next round. ",4

Some of those added features are however invaluable, like the network graphs that might help more people see through the algorithmic echo chambers dominating social media at the moment (while they off course won't be uncreated at the same time. Overall this proposal will probably have some positive impact. Considering the big amount of data, we will see whether a good scalability solution will be devised to run this on the blockchain.

The team is transparent about their members (at least those they have so far) and about the budget.

A slightly negative thing is that a Plutus/haskell developer has not yet been acquired. The roadmap is satisfying and a contigency plan was made to adress possible risks. Technicalities are explained sufficiently to identify what is going to be done. Overall good feasibility.",4,"In my opinion the proposal is pretty clear in what is going to be achieved, so the WHAT is being audited part is pretty easy to figure out. The metrics/KPIs make sense, are a bit brief however and could encompass more of the parameters discussed before. What bothers me is that at the moment the only way to track the progress of the project is to sign up to the project and in the process also give consent to the usage of the social media data. I definetely recommend finding another way to track the progress. You might also consider providing your code on Github.",4
1998,"F9: Dapps, Products & Integrations",DecentralizeMusic.com,https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBzUn,z_assessor_2259,1,0,414289,26595,"The idea of ​​the proposal is very good, and theoretically it aligns very well with the objectives of the challenge, because it will create a platform aimed at the music industry, in which artists would have more control over their art, and would also increase the contact between them and their fans, through various technologies pertinent to blockchain. This would achieve the specific objectives of the challenge in terms of adding new active members to the community, increasing the number of active digital wallets, circulating Ada and CNFTs, etc. However, I have some observations to make. I have no doubts about the impact and revolution that this project could create, as artists would create profiles, sell goods, music, NFTs, etc., keeping control of most transactions (which would be smart contracts). From what I understand, it would also be possible to perform some virtual shows, which already happen from the project presented on the jazzisdead website. The great idea here, in my opinion, would be to reduce bureaucracy and the profits that recorded companies have with the commercialization of content generated in the music industry; once these become active tokens, they can be handled much more easily by both artists and fans/end users. However, a big challenge that I believe needs to be taken into account would be: how would fans and artists get to know about Cardano's development tools, needed to run the functionality? This obstacle is mentioned directly by the proponents as well, that is, it is positive as they are aware of this possible difficulty to be faced during the practical development of the project. I would like this question to be more widely debated and thought about. Would there be some kind of practical manual on the website itself, instructions? How will people who have no contact with the cryptographic universe safely use and handle the tools and functionalities mentioned here? If this problem is resolved and circumvented properly, I believe that this proposal has a lot of potential and could bring great gains to the Cardano ecosystem, since it is dealing with a giant industry that moves a lot of money, involves many people. However, the barrier of technical knowledge must be broken, people must be educated in a clear and assertive way, we know that blockchain technology is increasingly popular and widespread, but not all people have such knowledge, and music is universal, so it's important that we make this platform accessible to all audiences. Therefore, I will give it 4 stars, if this problem is solved I believe the impact will be maximum.",4,"The proposal script is very specific in the sense of telling us what needs to be done and in what order, however, the temporal notion is a little confusing. As I understand it, everything said is pertinent to phase 2, but how long, in months, for example, would this phase last? And these little activities, how long would each last? Which professionals would work in them, and what would their work routines be like? Only if we can have a good understanding of the process, mainly because the proponents also provide us with observations, this could be even better if a time division was more specific and also if the explanation of each activity itself was more detailed. Unfortunately, when it comes to budgeting, the total asking amount of 100k is split quite broadly, meaning we know that 30k would go to project management and 15k to marketing for example. But what would the project manager's activities be, how many hours per month would he work on this project? We do not, therefore, know what the value of your working hour is, thus making it more difficult to understand whether the amount requested is fair and compatible with current market values. When it comes to marketing, I would like the publicity campaign to be better explained. I believe that advertising is a crucial part of the success of this project, as the intention here is to bring those involved with an already well-established industry to blockchain technologies. So how can we be sure that the maximum number of people would be reached, coerced into adopting this platform? How could artists and fans understand the advantages of the project, in relation to what is already traditional in the music industry? That is, if the marketing campaign were better explained, we would understand how this crucial part for the project would develop and also if the asking value makes sense. Finally, analyzing the team, unfortunately this part leaves a lot to be desired since we don't know much information about each of those involved. We are only told their names and professional roles, but we don't know their resumes, we don't have their linkedin profiles, we don't know how they relate to the Cardano ecosystem. If such information were passed on, certainly our security in relation to the team's preparation for the project would benefit. With that, I think that all 3 main parts of feasibility provide us with information that is useful, but lacks detail to understand if the proposal is safely viable. So I'll give it 4 stars because I believe the information given is valid, but it can be better detailed.",4,"Talking about how this project could be monitored, I think we can divide the analysis into two main parts: the monitoring of the process, that is, the unfolding of the phases, and also the measurement of success. Talking first about the last part, the measurement of success, the proponents tell us what the desired scenario would be in general - that a new wave of users would be attracted to Cardano, through the platform that offers various services related to the music business. We also know of more specific factors that could prove whether this happened, such as: the creation of the 3 types of profile on the platform (artist, record label or fan), the interactions between them, subscription to offers, participation in live broadcasts, creation and commercialization of CNFTs and so on. In other words, we have many palpable ways of understanding whether the project got where it wanted to go. However, I think it would also be important to think about two more things when it comes to this. First, I would like a qualitative analysis of the project to be done as well, in addition to quantitative data. That is, to understand the satisfaction of different types of users towards this project, as well as whether they have become active members of the Cardano community in other ways, for example, getting involved in other types of projects, in games, delegating Ada, minting active tokens that are not necessarily involved in the music field, etc. It would be very interesting for the proponents to carry out this general study and bring this information to the Cardano community in a summarized way, which could be done through, for example, a written report and disseminated through the communication channels of our community. Or, also, there could be a page on the website specially dedicated to understanding the impact of all this for Cardano, a place where the users themselves could express themselves, for example. Now, focusing on monitoring the process: it is super important for us to understand how the activities are being developed, how the phases are unfolding, etc., and not just what was generated from them. Proponents claim that the project will be managed with some tools like JIRA, slack and github commits. Besides github, I'm not familiar with the other tools, so for me it would be important to clarify how they work and the feedback they could give to our community, in relation to being always updated with the progress of this project. Thus, I agree that it is a proposal for a possible audit, but some points can still be improved.",4
2084,"F9: Dapps, Products & Integrations",“Cardania” educative board game,https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZB0iH,z_assessor_2259,1,0,418772,26595,"Yes, the proposal is very well aligned with the main objectives of the challenge. It is about creating a board game, which, according to the proponent, “uses traditional elements such as dice, hourglass, board and puzzle cards, and can be played in teams or individually. The goal is to overcome puzzles and certain activities to simulate how the blockchain works.” The problem raised is very real, there is no very simple (much less fun) way for people without a technical background to learn about blockchain and Cardano. So the strategy of running a game that can engage people by overcoming challenges they can handle is very necessary. The proponent also states that some activities would be carried out during the match - it would be interesting for him to describe more about them in the scope of the proposal. although it was not explained so clearly in the proposal (""it is an educational board game with dynamic difficulty where participants buy cards from different decks to advance on the board as quickly as possible, while earning rewards as they progress and affect the board mechanics through ""Smart Contracts""); the bidder provides an attached document where he explains better about the game mechanics. This is very positive, but I think the best way to understand would be with a video demonstration of some game, it would be great if this was also made available, as it would greatly increase our level of understanding about the exact functioning of each game. In addition to developing the game itself, the idea is to promote a series of events, which from what I understand would be tournaments. Students would compete, under the guidance of instructors, compete for prizes, and learn about a range of topics in the crip world. graphic, as mentioned in the attached document: “what are cryptocurrencies? what is Blockchain? what are consensus mechanisms? First Generation Blockchain, Test of Work, Second Generation Blockchain, Smart Contracts” and etc. It is positive as the proponent intends to reach a very high number of faculties (200), but it would be even better if he scored some examples of places where he would work; how he would draw students' attention to events and so on. About the events themselves, we don't have as many explanations attached, we know the percentage of the prize that would be distributed among the winners and etc, but a lot is said about how these events would be planned and organized. Another very important part of the proposal is the survey of risks and possible solutions, well established by the proposer. I believe that the main objective to be accomplished here would be to attract new people to the Cardano community through a new product (the game). More specifically, the topics present in the scope of the challenge that I think are directly related to the proposal are: “Increasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases + Creation or improvement of different Dapps, products, and integrations that provide value to the Cardano community and wider ecosystem + Integrations with other existing services, products, and protocols that improve the end-user experience whether that's giving the user more options or making something easier to use that benefits the wider ecosystem”. That said, in terms of impact, despite some small pieces of information being missing, the project seems very beneficial and fully aligned with the proposed challenge.",5,"In the matter of the script, unfortunately the information is not passed in an adequate way. I believe that a series of activities would need to be developed for the project to become possible as a whole: in addition to the development of the game itself (improved card and board design + packaging design + create 200 board games). But first commenting on these activities, it would be very positive if we had more detail about each. How would the card and packaging design be created? Which professional would be responsible for this? In the team presentation, no one is introduced as a designer; So would you hire an extra professional for that? Now speaking in relation to the organization of the events, there is no comment on any activity that talks about the pre-production of the same, that is, how to get in touch with the schools (and which schools); how to set the event date; whether there would be any outreach campaigns, so that students who 1) have never heard of blockchain; 2) is not from the technology area; may be interested in the meetings… It is said in which provinces the events would take place per month, but much more detail should have been given, as I mentioned. The responsibilities of instructors and coordinators are good examples of these activities that should have been better explained. (eg: “Coordinate and supervise quality standards in the manufacture of games. Organize the logistics of learning events in schools/institutes in Ecuador. Interview with school authorities/institutes in Ecuador”). Talking about the costs, the amount requested is high, in my view, and it is well explained and a few points - as in the breakdown of the cost to create the game, we know exactly how much each little part would cost, like the decks, deck separators, boxes and etc; But other expenses could be better argued. We know what the salaries of instructors and coordinators would be, but we don't know how many hours they would dedicate each month to creating the game, so it's not possible to understand the amount charged per hour of work. On the part of air and bus tickets, it would be beneficial to understand which tickets would be, how many would they be, from where to where, and if there would be no way to make this expense cheaper (for example, instead of air travel, it could be organized so that you can who lived closer to the colleges to organize events there, I don't know). All this could be better explained. Finally talking about the team, once again this topic is also not suitable, unfortunately. We don't know who the team members are in detail. In total there will be 5 people, only 3 of which are already defined (ideally, they all were). And about David, Fernando and Andrés, it would be necessary to attach a résumé about each one, explaining what their areas of training are and how they relate to Cardano, and not just their linkedin profiles. For these reasons, I believe there is still a lot to be reformulated on the topic of feasibility.",3,"The metrics raised to monitor progress only allow us to understand the partial results and are entirely numerical: “Number of board games delivered to schools/technical institutes after the learning session + players participating in the game + portfolios created”. I believe that a number of necessary information are pending. For example, how could we monitor the improvement of the game's design, its distribution among educational institutions, the definition of these places for the tournaments, the publicity of the events, how many students would be engaging and in what way? The first thing that could be improved is the detailing of the roadmap, we understand more precisely what would need to be done, how, by whom, when… Unfortunately, the way this auditability is suggested, it is not possible to adequately monitor the activities that would be behind these partial successes. So my suggestion is that the bidder first make the script more accurate; then, create reports at the end of each month, with updates on how the professionals involved have been working, in addition to the KPIs mentioned here; and after that is easily achievable by our community. This communication channel could be on the discord server reserved for us to audit the funded proposals. We know that a monthly report is always sent to the Catalyst coordinators, but our community needs to be aware of the news as well. Talking now about the success scenario, again the suggested information is scarce, the success indicators are also entirely numerical (""delivery of 200 board games to 200 schools/educational institutes after a learning session + participation of at least 6000 people in-game + creation of at least 800 wallets). It is necessary that we have a much deeper understanding of the consequences of the project. Were all the planned tournaments held? How was the involvement of the students who participated? If there would be 200 faculties, the goal is for 6000 people to participate in the tournaments, so 30 people are expected to participate in each event. Would they have gone? And how could we understand how, after playing and understanding blockchain better, they would have joined the cryptographic community? Had they become active members of our community? Would technology students have engaged in studying our tools, such as Cardano's programming languages ​​(Haskell and Plutus)? Would those young people who are not in the technology area have sought to get involved with blockchain, either through Catalyst (such as PAs, for example), or by becoming project interns, in the various areas that we need skilled labor? As can be seen, a series of research could be done. My suggestion is that the proponent keeps in touch with some participants of the events after the event so that they can collect this feedback and present it to us, for example, during some post Townhall space. Unfortunately, the topic still has a lot to improve.",2

The MVP was funded by Catalyst F8.
This proposal offers to lower the entry barrier to this application (as it currently requires hardware and network expertise) by developing a lite version deployed in the Adosia decentralized Marketplace. This proposal meets the challenge criteria, as its purpose is to increase the quality of an existing product in response to customer feedback. This will foster quick market integration by Adosia.
",5,"This team has already proven his ability to deliver projects (F8 Adosia Spaceprinter MVP, Dripdropz), and this project does not require new specific skills that the team does not already have. 
The solution is well described, with a user story : the lite printer will enable users with no hardware/no network expertise to participate in providing production to the marketplace. This will be achieved by the mean of a smartcontract that will handle each step, from the purchase order of an NFT that includes the printable file, to the payment of the registered printer operator and of the 3D designer that made the file.
The budget seems reasonable for the work described, but it is lacking a breakdown in identifiable items.

In fact, we still haven't noticed a great integration between the current music platforms with concepts and technologies that can be implemented by the Cardano ecosystem. Thinking from this point of view, and taking into account everything that the platform in question aims to accomplish, we have that the amount being requested is consistent. However, the scope of the actions to be taken raises a little doubt whether too big a step is being taken. As previously mentioned, there is still no clear integration between blockchain technologies with the music market, and the project's great differential would be to bring several features related to this integration. The fear lies in the fact that perhaps the market is not yet ready for this, and a large amount of capital would be being used in a non-optimal way. The medium and long-term impacts on Cardano's ecosystem are quite positive if this project is successful. However, linked to this is also a considerable risk.",3,"Regarding the explanation of the steps that will be carried out in the construction of the project, we realize that there may have been a little more detail on the motivation for carrying out each of them. In the section on the details of the plan, we have that the information transmitted appears to have a very technical character, with general explanations about what the 'body' of the platform will be like. But it would be nice to understand the reason for carrying out these implementations. Regarding the professionals involved behind the project, we noticed that they have different specializations, not only being focused on the technology area, but also having people experienced in project management and event production, such as Marcus Gray and Andrew Lojero, respectively. This makes us believe in the team's ability to solve a plurality of problems that may arise during development. Despite all these positive characteristics, we cannot fail to mention that perhaps many fronts are being attacked simultaneously in this current business plan. One possibility would be to choose a specific type of blockchain integration to implement and focus as much as possible on developing it. With this, it might even be possible to reduce the expenditures explained in the budget details. Currently, the amounts allocated there for different functionalities make sense, when we consider the plurality of actions to be performed.

The proposal has also succeeded on identifying a few risks and the corresponding mitigations.",5,"The team involved with this project consists of two persons that bring a lot of knowledge and experience on the blockchain technology, marketing, technical writing and particular in the Cardano space. The proposal provides enough information about their profiles which they increase the confidence of a successful implementation.
The timeline of project execution is split into monthly periods and a detailed description for each activity is included. The total 6 month period required for the project to be completed looks realistic. 
The budget has the form of a reasonable monthly salary for the two project members. Although a minor point it would be nice to break the costs in more identifiable items and the expected time to invest.
The proposal explains also that it will request further funding in the future to add more educational content so that the scaling of the solution is guaranteed.",5,"The proposal provides an excellent plan to track the progress of the project by using tools built by the community. The milestones are clearly defined and the project will issue monthly reports to Catalyst to ensure its auditability.

The proposal is sent in the dApps challenge and one could expect that it should be about developing a dApp, which is not the case. However, the proposal meets perfectly the challenge goals because it is expected to contribute indirectly to all those developing dapps and ideas that can be pitched in the events. Moreover, the challenge itself is open to anything that brings value to the ecosystem. Therefore, a rationale of 5 is appropriate here. ",5,"The proposal is well detailed and the proposers were carefully and meticulous in closing all the gaps and identifying possible vulnerable points. Said that, it’s really difficult to apply penalties on the proposal’s design. The proposers also presented a full list of people involved in the execution, with respective roles and public profile links. 
What proposers might have left open is the fact that to coordinate all these conference passes is a huge amount of work, from selection, transfers, follow-up, and so on. Even that they already have a “big dedicated team ready to execute this Project”, They haven’t presented details on how Snapbrillia will absorb this workload. It doesn’t mean that they can not do it, but considering the size of the proposal and the requested budget, it would be important for the community to make sure that they can handle the task by providing also this information. In this case, a score of 4 is appropriate.

Proposer does a good job on describing how adopting and descentrilized web3 music platform could help to solve this problem and this is the final product being offered here. It is also aligned with challenge as a new Dapp that can potentially boost Cardano adoption is being developed (challenge kpis of ""Increasing the number of dapps and products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases.""). Moreover, this platform, as propsoer states, is 70% already complete so the value delivery to the community will be quick, which is very good. However, there are a few points to consider. Nowadays, there are plenty of music streaming apps (considering the ones centrilized). the majority of them have nearly all songs and artists one would like find. Therefore, there's a great switching cost for the users to move to an emerging one, that dont have (at least for now) all this content they can find in these other apps. it could be clearer here what is the main value proposition for users that would defintely make them migrate. Maybe if artists migrated only to this new descentrilized app but this is a great leap. The value proposition for artists is very clear, though. In the same sense, the competition with the current big players will not be easy as this is currently a pretty much established market. ",4,"AS for the plan, there's no specified timile, only a product backlog with the main features in it. It could be said here when they intend to deliver each of these features. I understand that a project like this will likely adopt na agile approach and that this would vary a lot but some idea on general times or milestones could be provided. This backlog seems to cover most of the final product with good level of details though.

This can certainly help to overcome language barries for both voter and proposers, as this interviews witll be translated in 3 languages. This, of course, addresses the challenge as it fits well in the challenge definition of success (""A broad spectrum of people across Asia and connected to Asia, coming together and forming teams to grow our ecosystem""). Moreover, this is a continuation from a project funded in F7 and proposer does a good job on presenting the overal numbers for this (38 videos recorded and more than half proposals funded). In this sense, it would be nice to bring also here the perceptions of the voters who did watch the videos and how they thought this helped them on clarifying about the proposal. Risk management is well done with 3 challenge well identified and a proper mitigation strategy in place.
In addition to the information provided, it wold be also nice to understand how proposer would select the proposals who want to have their videos recorded in case there's more demand for it than the capacity to execute these recordings. Other suggestion would be to include how proposer intends to expand and improve in relation to the past fund, it was funded and indicate if there'll be any modication in the dynamics.",5,"There's asequence of tasks/acitvities but they are not layed out in time, it just mentions it will serve for F9 and 10. it would be nice to see how many weeks or days each task would take , or even the amount of time required for each video, considering its whole cycle (proposal engagement, record, editing, translations and promotions).
Budget breakdown is reasonable and matches project scope. it decomposes the costs mainly in the tasks or roles (if its associated to a person) by each video to get o the total of each video and the sums up the total number of videos, which is a nice and transparent approach. 
Regarding the team, it has 2 people in it, with already experience in such project in the past and background in translations. Linkedin links are provided.

This approach may lead to a growing in interest by the kids nowadays by gamefying the learning and making it possible to play toegther with their colleaguer. This is also aligned with challenge as creates a phsycal product connected to Cardano, which is one of ptential types of proposals included in challenge description. The game mechanism is provided in an attached file.
Some considerations:
1) Kids/teens nowadays may not be so keen on psyhcal games, instead, they might prefer computer/online games. This could be one extra risk to be incoportated in risk part. To overcome this, it could be ellaborated (maybe in the future), an online or PC/mobile version of the board game. This would also probably extend the reach to other regions and create the opportunity to have online rewards/competitions. In the same sense, it would be nice to understand how much kids are indeed playing boardgames nowadays. Maybe do some resaeach and bring some numbers on how is the selling profile by age of these games, in general or how the school in the country have been using board games as educational method. On the other hand, this is though, an opportunity to take blockchain to low-income regions where computers and internet are not so common (as might be the reality of many places in Ecuador). This could be the focus/target of this project. However, if they get interested, they would still have to overcome this barrier to learn more and participate in the ecosystem.
2) blockchain concepts are not usually taught in school nor is something kids/teens have had much contact since nearly getting into university, which may make the game hard and discourage to be played. There could be some references in the games for them to learn more (in an easy and non-technical way) about each concept and lesson approached in the game.
3) some examples of the blockchain questions could be provided so PA and voters have some sense on how they would be approached in a non-technical way, which is not trivial (and possible even provide back feedback on how to improve them). By the way, collecting feedback both from the community and the validate the questions with the target audience would be very imporant before implementing the game for real, in a larger scale (as the distribution to 200 schools).
4) Last, one thing that got me wondering is if there's any intent of selling the board game (online or in pshycal stores) for example, besides the 200 schools, in the future. However, its understandable that this is outside the scope of this proposal.
Considering it all, I'll rate impact as 4. As I mention, its a different and interest approach on the teaching/learning process, in line with challenge, but there are some risks of not being so effective/impactful, as commented above. Its worth trying though.
",4,"There's a plan divided basically in 2 phases, one for finish creating the game and other to distribuite among the schools. The first phase even have some details on the acitvites to be developed spread in the weeks but more inromation could be provided for the 2nd one. There's probably plenty of support acitvities (such as getting in contact with the school, orgnizing the agenda, material and the sessions with the kids/teens, organiizing the travels) that could be included with their duration.
Budget breakdown is very clear and detailed, aligned with scope and plan. The cost for each piece of the game is provided just as the number of hours for each people that will be paid. Their roles are also very clear.
As for the team, there 3 people already committed and linkedin links are provided. However, a summarized text telling their main experience and competencies relevant for the project could be stated, besides these links. in additon, 2 other instructors will be necessary.
All in all, my rate is 4 as project plan and team could be improved.
",4,"There are good 3 kpis provided to audit this project with pre-defined goals, which is essential to assess success, later on. Some milestones are possible to be extracted from project plan as well but its imporant proposer communicate them properly in a public online space. In addition to the proposed metrics, I'd include a way to measure feedback on the game and somehow the level of learning or interest on blockchain after playing the game. Surveys or assessments could help on this.",4

I was impressed with the sentence in the proposal ""share the gospel of Cardano"".
I think of Cardano as a symphony that inspires the whole orchestra including the conductor and the members of the orchestra with different musical instruments that are inspiring the music community. .
 Proposing the content of organizing major conferences of all industries and giving free tickets to Cardano community members to promote Cardano themselves.
The solution offers each individual, each group is the representative of Cardano in each different industry to participate in conferences to exchange and build and develop more quality projects on Cardano. In addition, meetings at conferences will help unite the community to resolve conflicts of different opinions on how to build Cardano.
The vibrant atmosphere of the Cardano conference will spread and impress other communities, which will certainly bring a lot of value to Cardano. The risks are clearly stated and anticipated with the accompanying contingency solution",5,"A very detailed plan is built with specific timelines with events taking place in turn according to the expected time for the quna tam community to buy tickets or participate in exhibitions, register to participate in speeches. .
Many events and exhibitions will take place from the end of August 2022 to 2023.
The number of events and exhibitions organized is very large, so the proposed support budget is also very large, at least $ 5,000, up to $20,000.
I think the proposal needs to come up with a more detailed budget table for details of the budget allocated for each event, exhibition, and how many people.
The proposed budget source for reasonable contingency support because it is not possible to accurately measure the number of attendees, so there will be additional costs if the number of participants is larger.
Large team with many members, core members with a lot of personal information to talk about, all with blockchain technology and community experience, in different countries. It can be said that the proposal will create cultural interference in different countries. Proposing to have a strong team that will take on and execute the project well",5,"There are many proposed goals to measure project progress: track revenue, track attendance, drive conference attendance.
Detailed reports that specifically record each spending item will be updated, archived and made public for the community to verify, in addition, monthly reports for Catalyst also demonstrate transparency.
The community can envision the success of the project clearly: the Cardano community is empowered to be active ambassadors, many dApp projects are launched, the future generation of Cardano ambassadors will be nurtured and developed.
The biggest success I have seen from the project is creating a dynamic, confident, friendly and equal Cardano community, geographical distance is removed, language barrier is gone, only community remains. solidarity, love",5

Content is provided in 3 languages: English, Portuguese, Spanish. Disseminate the ability to deploy Solidity contracts in a Cardano EVN sidechain.
There are actually a lot of people and even I won't understand many of these terms. Therefore, providing content other than English will help the language community better understand the features and advantages of Cardano.
I see the proposal as a handbook for newcomers who are using other systems to learn or want to enter the Cardano ecosystem.
Another solution proposed is also very good translation tagging translated content in publications of influencers. It is well known that the influence of influencers in the community is huge and everything related to them is noticed and followed, which means that the proposal will also be known to many people.
If the proposal fails to find suitable quality publications to translate, this is the biggest risk I take on.

I find that this planner sticks to the solution. As I realize that the selection of publication content is very important, so the development of content is focused at all timelines.
The budget table of the proposed aggregated proposal lacks allocation details. I don't see how this budget will be allocated to which stage.
The first team member is a writer. An experienced copywriter, a technologist in analytics and systems development, is there a shortage of language staff in the proposal?

There also existing solutions out there who sell the same service by giving you a number and only trusted/desired calls or messages are forwarded to you. Secondly, their solution does not use Cardano at all. Thirdly, the team is requesting money mainly for research not building dApps, products or integrations for Cardano. The one benefit that might arise is that they will share their research findings publicly. Better web3 solutions already exist such as Helium Network which is building an actual decentralized telecommunications infrastructure right now with real users or wallet to wallet messaging apps with end to end encryption, it is better to find a way to collaborate with existing projects or at least justify how one might be better.",2,"The current team seems to have experience with the telco industry but they indicated needing to hire Plutus developers which probably means they can’t finish the project on their own should they fail to hire a dev. Other than that, it seems that the rest of the project is just research which should be doable if they know what they are doing, especially on the technical side, which they didn’t have any indication of, for example, they have only stated briefly that they will be “using Cardano as the foundational tech layer” but have never specified what exactly the blockchain will or might be used for, it is very vague.",3,"The team will share their research findings but because the goals are vague such as “triggers conversations” and “fast integrations of current possibilities”, it is hard to audit and determine if the project is really successful. Their metrics are also tied to PR outreach metrics such as number of impressions or running test cases instead of actual usage such as number of paying customers.

The problem is stated clearly that voters do not have time to read and understand proposals' insights. So the TV program can provide a quick means to get the community to understand. 
The interviews will be translated into several languages according to the proposer.
Addressing the challenge, the proposal seeks to help Asian proposers who find it difficult to write in English language, and the videos translated into their own language will help them understand Catalyst and write proposals. This will lead to onboarding Asians to have roles such as proposers, PAs and Voters as they have language friendly resources. This challenge is about getting Asians onboard Cardano blockchain and grow the ecosystem.

The proposer has explained that the core Cardano Press plugin is still in BETA and many projects are suing it successfully, but they need more development to complete to make it a stable version. Projects that want to build on Cardano for their NTF collection, NFT minting, ISPO, Stake Pools or online e-commerce sites will be able to install the plugin, configure it to Blockfrost and be integrated with a wallet DApp connector within minutes. 
Addressing the challenge, this proposal has said that CardanoPress relies 100% on the Blockfrost API, and that every project that uses and implements the CardanoPress plugin on its website must sign up to Blockfrost to use it. Thus, there will be more projects choosing Cardano and CardanoPress, meaning more sign-ups and usage of the Blockfrost API, and this is exactly what the challenge is all about.

The budget requested is $12000 and that is within the challenge limit. The breakdown is understandable showing costs in hours for various items like use testing, development , UI/UX design, etc. The highest cost of $6000 goes to development, and that makes a lot of sense, since the proposal is an App development based.

The team is qualified, looking at their experiences. Links to CardanoPress to check on the team is provided in the proposal. 
There is indication that the team will return to Catalyst for more support in the future for more development of the App. The team is also involved in other proposals in Fund9.
The information provided meets all the requirements and it is highly likely that this proposal will be implemented successfully. My rating is 5.",5,"In tracking the progress of this proposal, it is said in the proposal that the final goal of having the stable version will be seen progressively. But as to where it will be seen, it is not mentioned, such as GitHub, google sheets, etc.
The success story, according to the proposal, will be that more users and projects installed, and use of CardanoPress plugin to power and launch the websites. This will bring more users of Blockfrost to communicate to the Cardano blockchain. 
In the long term, they will see a flourishing ecosystem around the plugin where other WordPress and development agencies start using the plugin to create solutions for their clients. This proposal is new.
Apart from the absence of where to access progress reports such as GitHub, Discord or Catalyst channels, the information provided is alright to audit the success of the project. My rating is 4.",4

The proposed solution will certainly lead the wider adoption of Blockfrost API: a WP plugin is a simple and neat way of interacting with the API without the need of technical preparation such as PHP or JS programming language.
The proposer explains the risks that can prevent him to deliver the plugin: not being published in WP store can be quite a stopping barrier for wide adoption, but interested webmasters can also find the plugin in the official website, along with a well written, simple (yet incomplete) documentation.",4,"A WP plugin is strategic, being the most popular among the CMS, it will lead to mass adoption after being published in the WP plugin store.

CardanoPress already has a beta version and it fits extremely well in this challenge. The whole idea of the project is to facilitate the life of the user by removing the lack of knowledge of APIs and Cardano wallet integration barrier. That is done through a plugin heavily based on Blockfrost. This way the Cardano dApp development creation process gets smoother than ever. The metrics chosen are related to the usage of the plugin which in turn translates into the use of Blockfrost. In other words, it helps create an active ecosystem around Blockfrost. Finally, the proposer acknowledges that currently the project cannot sustain itself without external funding and suggests they may need to return to Catalyst for further funding. Regarding this point I would encourage them to start thinking about ways to monetize the project so it can reach a self-sustainable situation at some point.",5,"The team is highly qualified and have a lot of experience with WordPress. They have provided evidence of their skills and past experiences by means of links to LinkedIn and GitHub pages. The only one without evidence provided about experience is Karlo Ilanos. Within the budget breakdown they clearly point which type of skills will be needed to implement the activities of the project (software development, testing and UI/UX design, for example). They also state how much is requested for each task. The hours of work that will be necessary seems reasonable but the average hourly rate of USD 150 sounds a bit overpriced. The timetable is realistic and well organized. There seems to be enough time both for development and for testing. As there is already a beta version, they have considered the risks low. Nevertheless, two of them were raised, not having the plugin accepted into the directory and not being able to use Blockfrost for some reason. For the first one they provided a nice solution of reaching key people from the WordPress community. In the extreme case of that strategy not working out they could migrate to a different platform. For the second risk they offered a similar solution.",5,"The team has provided clear milestones within the roadmap described. It is divided in five phases that last one to two weeks and for each of them a deliverable was set. Additionally, the deadlines for each phase seem in line with the tasks that will be performed. The KPIs defined, on the other hand, are not very clear. The only precise and objective one they described was the number of users installing the CardanoPress plugin. They could also use the number of requests made to Blockfrost and number of acquired developers from the Crypto space as KPIs.

The solution proposed strongly fits the campaign as it implements an improvement supported by customer feedback and expanding usage by the community, increasing the quality of an existing product. The idea is to produce a lite version of the Spaceprinter that is fully cloud based. This version was born to allow users who do not own the hardware for a Spaceprinter, or who lack the technical expertise to network a hardware device, to still participate in providing production to the Adosia Decentralized Marketplace. The goals of the proposal strongly align with the ones from the campaign as they focus on expanding and improving an existing solution built on top of Cardano thus adding value to the ecosystem.",5,"The team is composed of eleven highly skilled members with a range of diverse backgrounds. However, no LinkedIn pages or equivalents were provided to support those claims with evidence. In the detailed plan it is not specified how many and what type of members will be required (which specific skills will be needed), but it is implicit in the plan the team of eleven will be enough to implement the project. However, the team has a record of deploying highly successful projects on Cardano, which plays in their favor. The budget is very lousy, there is no description of costs whatsoever, just the total amount required without any explanation of how the team estimated that value. The total amount of time needed is claimed to be four months but as the plan does not give details on how the development will be conducted it is hard to assess if it is realistic or not. The only risk raised is to find the best balance of features for the lite version to ensure users can at least minimally function without dedicated hardware, but still encouraging users to upgrade to a hardware Spaceprinter for better results, which is a pertinent risk. However, other risks such as delays, unexpected bugs or the solutions not being well accepted by the public could have been discussed.",3,"The roadmap provided is not very rich, the team has not given a lot of details of what exactly will be implemented in each stage of the development. As a suggestion they could have broken down the four-month development into sprints with milestones for each sprint and stated what the milestones were. This way their proposal would be much more transparent and easier to follow for an outsider. Instead of providing metrics they claim they use git and Trello to manage the project's progress but that's not the point of the measure tracking section. Instead, what is expected from the teams is that they provide objective KPIs so we can easily assess if the plan has achieved success or not. For example, they could have used rate of satisfaction from customer feedback, number of users adopting the new solution and number of people using the old solution to track if there has not been any cannibalization.

The strategic content aspect of online engagement is an interesting initiative, and I agree that a team consisting of developer/copywriter is an appropriate match, with a budget that is not bloated to accommodate the roles defined by the proposal.

Where I believe the impact will be challenged, especially in such a diluted content environment of social media and articles, is the distribution element.  Setting up and building new social media channels requires paid advertising or regular engaging posts to generate any substantial following, and therefore the key element to views is the partnerships that content creators are able to forge in that space.

Overall, I think the project aims to deliver a positive impact as presented, so long as the proposers are able to overcome the risks that their hard work will not reach its intended audience. ",4,"The budget and roadmap for delivery of this project are in line with a reasonable expectation to deliver the content proposed by the author's strategy.

The timeline/milestones presented in the proposal are kind of ""copy/paste"" repetition from month to month over a 6 month period, with no details on focused development of media partnership, creative design work, or any existing relationships that may be leveraged to facilitate success in those areas.  It was this reason that I hesitated to strongly support the proposal.  However I agree overall that structured approach to creation/delivery with a regular report on eyeballs is a valid approach to delivering accurate and thoughtful content that can aid in awareness, discovery, FAQ support, and assistance for the future of teams interested in the topic of migration.

The proposers interest in returning for future funds to participate in content production activity, in addition to their participation in other current/past projects, indicates that they understand the requirement to deliver impactful results that add value to the community, and therefore see the value in their transparency and success at this stage.",4,"I like that the proposal presents a clear, fixed metric for both content delivery, as well as a vision for success that is based on the performance of their distribution capability.  Together, those KPIs are capable of providing a clear indication to the community on the value of this investment in the determination of continuing these efforts.

I agree that the build and deliver approach is appropriately matched with a monthly reporting scheme, and like that the team has embraced an open and transparent plan for reporting, including tools like treasury guild, Dework, and gitbook to manage work and communicate results in a way that will be clear to analyze.",5

However, details of a defined problem/solution fit are limited as they lack a defined understanding of what Spaceprint is, information that is loosely presented in the proposal (some kind of cloud based 3D printing service?) and also not detailed through the relevant links provided.

The proposal seems to be a scaling project for previous project expansion/simplification, and therefore the sustainability of the underlying technology is not linked directly to delivery of this project - which is more of a usability and simplification effort.

I agreed but not strongly with this proposal because the key delivery plan is to build a Spaceprinter into the Adosia marketplace. 
 However, the proposal states that the MVP was already funded in Fund 8, and I can't find much info available about the outcome of that project, so I would have seen a more strong impact from this proposal had it contained a demonstrated success in the first phase.",4,"The team and working history is probably the strongest element of this proposers feasibility, having a long history of Catalyst/Cardano participation, and a host of relevant skills and participation on previous projects that are traceable online.

Where the proposal lacks clarity, is that it the budget is not clearly broken down for the $50k USD budget.  There is limited information about how the funds will be spent.

For roadmap, the team mentions a 4 month timeline, likely an estimate since they clarify a 6x/week meeting schedule, more of an agile methodology.

Overall, the technical and architectural specs and challenges in the proposal are defined in very limited detail for someone who is not already deeply familiar with Spaceprinter or Adosia, and that is also clear when the author specifies that the risks lie in features development and upgrade timeline.

Finally, the team mentions tracking work on git and trello, but the only relevant link provided is for Adosia.com.  I can't find much relevant info about Spaceprint on that link, although I can find other resources on Google, but I'm not sure if it's the same project since those references are not provided in this propsal.",3,"I'm neutral on the auditability for this proposal because the plan presented offers a clear general overview of what the proposal team aims to delivery, but very limited detail on what is required to do so.

5090,"F9: Dapps, Products & Integrations",DecentralizeMusic.com,https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBzUn,z_assessor_2531,0,1,414289,26595,"DecentralizeMusic.com is a live streaming music platform that aims to become a viable alternative to current centralized providers like Spotify, allowing artists to create profiles, sell their products, music and NFT using the Cardano blockchain, this should bring fans closer and artists and allow them to continue to receive royalties on their musical productions in the future and forever. All this should lead a large number of users to approach Cardano. Bringing even 0.1% of the quarterly subscribers of a company like Spotify would mean chaining 180,000 users to Cardano. Not to mention that spotify is not the only leading company in the sector.
(https://www.businessofapps.com/data/spotify-statistics/)
Consequently, I believe that this proposal meets the objectives set by the Dapps, Products & Integrations challenge, however similar solutions are already being developed on the Cardano blockchain and another project has been financed in the fund8, I suggest to the proposer to evaluate possible collaborations:
- https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/396558",5,"The proponent reports that the live streaming, music streaming / physical merchandise and social aspects components are already completed and defines precisely how the CNFT market will be implemented during phase 2 but there is no defined time horizon. Unfortunately I have tried several times to register on the platform but without success and since there are no channels to ask or a support service I had to give up, I suggest the team to work on this aspect. As for the social components; Twitter and instagram are practically empty while the youtube channel seems quite active even if with a low number of subscribers.
The project launch has reportedly been aligned with over 30 events and tours organized by Jazzisdead.co (see current events jazzisdead.co/EVENTS).
I was able to find the following team members online (Links and references of past experiences were missing in the proposal, I suggest adding them):
-Marcus Gray (https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcus-gray-90a59947/) who demonstrates years of experience in Project menaging and system engineering
-Andrew Lojero (https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-lojero-17462432/) Event Producer / Artist Management / Record Label Co-owner
However, I was unable to identify the other team members and unfortunately the team reports that being an overseas team, they have no reference links or links on the pages
Abhi - Head of the development project
Devendra - Python developer
Fizanul - Frontend Developer / React
Again I suggest adding references / evidence / links to past experiences.
 
The proposal shows a royalty cost of $ 0.01 per stream. However, the team is aware of the lack of knowledge of the Cardano development tools needed to execute the features, so there is no evidence of the sustainability of such a royalty cost paid to artists.
According to data reported by GlobalWebIndex (https://www.gwi.com/reports/music-streaming-around-the-world), the average North American user listens to an average of 140 minutes of music per day.
Taking into account an average of 3 minutes per song we are talking about 47 songs per day for a value of 47 * 0.01 $ = 0.47 $ (per day to be paid as Royalties), per month the calculation becomes 0.47 $ * 30 = 14.1 $.
This is therefore a higher cost than that incurred for a monthly subscription on Spotify (9.99 $).
Furthermore, microtransitions are not currently available on cardan, so a solution is needed on this front as well to avoid further raising costs for the consumer and lowering earnings for the artist. You could consider an idea such as grouping transitions until a threshold agreed with the rights holder is reached, once this is reached the payment will be sent.
At the same time, it should be borne in mind that Spotyifi pays an average of $ 0.003 per stream to the artist, so there is a good margin for maneuver.
(https://magicviral.com/marketing-news/194-come-guadagnare-con-itunes-and-altri-servizi-di-streaming-musicale.html#strongguadagnareconlamusicasuitunesstrong)
 
I suggest the team to hire experienced staff in the Cardano development tools necessary for the implementation of the features in order to define more precise and sustainable costs.
The required budget is divided into identifiable items, however it lacks specificity in defining the number of hours of work and the hourly cost required for front-end and backed development, I also suggest adding evidence / estimate of the legal cost ($ 35,000)
According to what has been reported, it is likely that the proposal will need additional funds to be carried out, however there is no defined plan in this regard.
It is possible the proposal can be implemented, counting a beta and a record label to support it, however a more precise plan of timing and technical aspects is needed, moreover the music sector is a very competitive sector in which it could be useful to forge collaborations with other houses. record companies, I suggest to the team to consider also in this sense",2,"The roadmap, currently in phase 2, includes identifiable milestones but lacks defined timelines. The team plans to use project management tools such as JIRA, slack and github is committed to tracking progress and milestones, but there is no link at the moment.
According to when written in the proposal Successor looks like adoption and operations however are kpi metrics defined to measure it. An example could be:
number of artists registered on the platform
number of monthly unique listeners registered on the platform
number of average daily / weekly / monthly reproductions per user
total value of the transitions made on the platform",4

Your proposal aligns with the goal set in the Challenge and it directly adds value to the Cardano ecosystem, which is great for the project owner and those interested in the project (for voting, reviewing investment, accumulation of knowledge, etc.). I think the proposal could fully scale in the future with lots of short video interviews (still between 5-8 minutes - this is a feature of the show) but more interviews with more proposals, not only limited to Vietnam but also in other countries in the region, made by collaborators under the arrangement of Ms. Mie (this is my idea to be able to scale up) until this moment).

The videos that you have made (shown in the proposal) and the disclosure of your identity through social networks (Linkedin) make me very confident in you and confirm the feasibility of the proposal. The budget is broken down and presented with a reasonable amount attached. In this Fund 9, if Catalyst has not funded the proposal, will you continue to work on the proposal? My advice is that if possible, you should do your best to arrange financial and human resources to do it. Even if there are only enough resources to make 1 or 2 videos. Because that is the maintenance necessary for the survival of Catalyst TV through all times of the year. This should be maintained regularly, as regularly as possible. Why is Catalyst TV maintenance important? I would say the reason is for it to become a certain brand (this is only formed when Catalyst TV appears regularly) and gradually become an indispensable thing for project investors who need to collect information.

This speaks to your very good preparation for the job at Catalyst TV. I'm happy with this route but would suggest that it would be much better if the route was tied to specific months of the year. Example: Specific work to implement in January, February, March... - this is just an example). I think that doing so will increase the transparency and auditability of the proposal. It will be easier for the community to audit based on the months of the year. You've come up with five measures of success, which are also key performance metrics (these are mostly related to people's interactions) - very logical. It shows your understanding of the interactivity of community media - this is essential when making proposals, especially those that are heavily socialized that require high interaction.

My understanding is that the impact of this proposal comes in two folds: (1) marketing impact for Cardano (by sending ambassadors to conferences) and (2) marketing impact for Snapbrillia (by receiving the support from Fund9 for user acquisition). I may have missed other impacts if stated in the proposal. While the community impact is very valid, I am not sure it serves to solve the challenges within Daaps, Products & Integrations Challenge. For the impact on Snapbrilla itself, I would love to see how it translates into the impact on the Cardano ecosystem as a whole.
",4,"I agree with the feasibility of this proposal. The proposal list out the conferences the team wishes to set up exhibitions at and for which they will purchase tickets for the community, as well as the team in Snapbrillia who will work on the project. It is, however, not clear to me what skill sets are required to send 500 communities to conferences. For example, I would look for the skills, and man-hour, to work with the conferences, work with the community, and select community members to send to different conferences. It is also not clear on what basis and criteria the team will select community members to give them the tickets, whether it is on the 1st come 1st serve basis, or if the team will spend more effort to assess which people could better serve as Cardano ambassador, or if the tickets are given on the need-based basis. If the team plans to use the requested funding to expand Snapbrillia, I'd suggest the team focus more on the impact and implementation of Snapbrillia itself. In short, I am not sure how the team will implement the plan in a fashion that optimizes the return on investment of the $3925000 funding they ask for. If we aim to send 500-1000 community members to conferences, we are looking at $392 - $785 per person, and I wonder if we have any benchmark in ROI for community outreach and expansion.
",4,"I agree that the project is auditable. The proposal identifies clear Metrics and KPIs that define the success of the ambassadorship and the branding impact that it has to the Cardano community (e.g., engagement metrics, videos, pictures).

The team proposes to build 6 additional features for the Adiosia Decentralized Manufacturing Marketplace, whose MVP proposal was funded by Fund8. This proposal aims to further develop a marketplace dApp on Cardano in order to increase the dApp utility and improve the experience for both consumers and manufacturers on the marketplace, thus it is aligned with the challenge settings. What I miss from the proposal in order to better assess its impact are (1) data, numbers, or quantitative metrics that serve as a proxy to evaluate the magnitude of its impact, for example, how many more new user accounts or transactions it expect the new features would generate. Moreover, as the Marketplace MVP is still being developed, I do not have the proxy to gauge how much demand is there for it, thus it would be helpful for the proposer to provide early customer feedback, the number of waitlists, etc,; (2) I hope the proposer would add in their considerations to scale the project sustainably in the future.
",4,"I am neutral on the feasibility of this proposal. On the positive note, this proposal shares the core team members with the Adosia Marketplace MVP project which was funded in Fund8, thus there are synergies in the team to carry out both proposals. The team demonstrates relevant experience in IoT and embedded systems, industrial engineering, quality management, technical architecture, and blockchain. The features proposed do not appear to be very difficult to implement (e.g., profiles for operators), except for the automated shipping integration feature that the proper notes in the risks and mitigation section. However, even for relatively easy-to-implement features, I would expect the proposer to provide a more detailed roadmap (currently, the proposer only mentions that the implementation will last for 4 months) and key deliverables for each phase/month. The proposer should also provide the planned roles and estimated man-days for each feature (currently, the budget is broken down by feature only). Last but not least, had the proposer been able to discuss some technical aspects, system design, or user stories for the proposed features, it would have been much more helpful. 
",3,"I am neutral on the auditability of this proposal. While the goal is straightforward (i.e., deploying the 6 proposed features to the Adosia Decentralized Manufacturing Marketplace), I would expect (1) a more detailed roadmap and milestones to audit if the project is on-track; and (2) metrics to assess the quality and imact of the implementation, for example, # of bug fix, downtime, website visits, # of customers, # of operators). The proposer mentions that the team will submit monthly reports to Catalyst with the percent completed on the projects listed in this proposal. This proposal is a also continuation of Fund8's Adosia Marketplace MVP, thus monitoring the previous proposal may provide some data points for this proposal. Nevertheless, I would recommend proper to see this one as a standalone proposal in terms of feasibility and auditability and provide sufficient information to the community accordingly.

The team has already started that process which shows very realistic expectations.",5,"The evaluation looks at appropriate measures, such as an increase in users and installs.

What is lacking is hard numbers to look at. The team knows the current number of downloads and installs. The audit could be improved by stating those numbers and setting objective goals for growing them.

Therefore, it is very difficult for voters to understand what ideas the project is trying to solve, how to do it, measure performance, and monitor the community by reading the entirety of the proposal. Besides, the main language that Catalyst uses for proposals is English, which should be a big barrier for voters in non-English speaking countries.

So, your suggestion is to create a video interview from 5-8 minutes for proposers to present the main contents of their proposal, which is very useful for voters, saving them a lot of time and effort to evaluate and decide to vote for the project more confidently.

These interview videos are all made for free and edited with high quality, so proposers can also use them as marketing materials for their proposals to help save costs when the project does not know if the project has a fund or not.

The team's suggestions were very helpful and had a great impact on the Cardano community, especially on proposers and voters.",5,"Your proposal is expected to be implemented in 02 funds of the Catalyst program: fund9 and fund10, with the goal of interviewing 40 proposals for each fund. The main tasks for making videos have also been described in detail such as sending invitations to proposers with pre-prepared questions, conducting interviews, editing videos, attaching subtitles to videos, and finally posting videos. to their marketing channels to promote the proposal to the voter. The implementation process is very clear, simple, and easy to understand.

The cost you want to apply for the proposal is $19020 for a total of 80 videos expected to be produced. The cost of video production has been specified and has a corresponding cost, so in my opinion, this budget level is suitable for the scale and goals of the proposal.

About the members of the project team, there is Mie Tran, who is very active in the Catatyst community in Asia. With the experience of producing 38 videos for propopsals at fund7, fund8 and more than half of the proposals were funded when accepted for an interview by Catalyst TV. This is a quite impressive result that can prove that Mie Tran can perfectly perform for videos at fund9 and fund10.",5,"Regarding the evaluation of the project's performance, the community can fully follow the Catalyst TV Youtube channel because all the videos interviewing proposers are posted here.

In addition, the team also outlined criteria to be able to evaluate the quality and impact of the video through the number of views, the number of feedback, and comments, especially the number of proposals be funded when they joined the Interview on Catalyst TV.

I also have a suggetion for the project that maybe after each fund you can do a small survey with those who have participated in the interview so that they can comment on the quality of the video, the preparation as well as the benefits actually that proposers get from this project. From there, you will have more insights to improve the operational efficiency of the project.",5

Education as a tool to foster  migrations from Ethereum to Cardano, this is amazing. Part of the reasons why migrations to cardano have been slow is because developers might not be aware that there is the need for such, so therefore I believe that if developers are well informed on this need, Cardano could see an influx of projects from developers. Therefore, the problem is in congruence with the challenge. Increasing circulation of strategic content about EVMs on Cardano as well as curate and translate other relevant related content would fast track would bring new innovations to Cardano because developers would be well informed to build Ethereum basedprojects in the ecosystem. 
The key metrics of the proposal are in alignment with the challenge setting. I also believe that the project can be suit into future challenges because it’s an educative one.

I find it difficult to  ascertain whether the budget cost would be rightly used for the execution of the project or not.
There is a good plan and timetable for executing the project. The roadmap is clear on how the success expected would be achieved and that for me is good.

The problem identified is clear and I believe that the proposed solution is effective to address the problem.

The fact that the platform in the proposal will combine the offering of music, merchandise and ticket sales, etc., is a significant advantage against other big players like Spotify. Furthermore, the implementation of NFTs is kept simple and is aimed at the broader audience by using three tears when buying albums, NFTs for ticket sales and NFTs for lottery tickets.
The project actively educates people on Cardano on their website decentralizemusic.com. The information is aimed at the platform users and is clear and brief. I’m optimistic about this information because this gives me the sense they acknowledge the importance of education when working with new technology for the average user this platform is aimed at. ",4,"The 0,01 cent per stream for the artist on the live streaming platform is feasible for the artist and is more than the average pay-out on the Spotify platform. However, I’m also of the opinion that music professionals want more control over their business. 
The project team is listed, but I would advise including an easy way to get to the CVs of the team members involved.
In the proposal is stated that the project is already 70% completed. They have a platform and website in Beta, and the fact they never received funding in previous rounds gives me confidence in the project. ",4,"I’m missing a breakdown of goals and self-imposed deadlines. I would advise adding a roadmap to the proposal. There are no KPIs in the proposal to measure what success would be like for the proposal. You can use metrics such as songs streamed, albums sold and stream library size, for example. Goals for the proposal should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and Time-bound (SMART principle).
The statement “We will utilize project management tools such as JIRA, slack as well as Github commits to track progress and milestones.” is not specific enough. You could, for example, link existing Github commits in this section so we can see what this communication would look like. ",2

The idea here is to build a Cardano Catalyst program - where that proposer can participate to interview Ms.Mie Tran about issues surrounding their proposal such as ideas, solutions, roadmaps, etc. This presentation will be recorded and editing/translated into other languages ​​(English, Vietnamese, Japanese,...) for posting on media sites, the purpose is to, i) firstly help communities when the English language is not an official language can understand what is the content of the proposals on Catalyst are made without having to spend a lot of time to read and understand, ii) second is for the community to have a place to interact discuss with project owners about the issues that the community asks, helping them to have more information to make a decision to vote for that project or not, iii) thirdly, this program will be a tool that proposer can use to promote their project to more places. All of the above benefits will contribute to increasing the value of Catalyst, attracting more new ideas and proposals in the following funds as well as increasing brand awareness. I therefore strongly agree with this idea.",5,"The feasibility of this proposal I assess is entirely possible because of the following aspects:
-This is a continuation of the success of the funded proposal in Fund7, the results achieved by the project team in Fund7 are extremely impressive therefore I think the proposer has a lot of experience to continue implementing this time.
-About the experience of each member: as I mentioned above, all members of the project have had experience in previous Funds. In addition, Ms.Mie Tran is also a very familiar face in Eastern Townhall sessions and is also a member of the Challenge Team.
-About the budget: very specific and detailed about the cost of implementation for each work item, the cost explained here is extremely reasonable. However, I have a small suggestion for proposer that consideration should be given to the addition of the hedging fee because of ADA price fluctuations. 
- The execution time for each job is also clearly divided from the beginning, ensuring the right schedule. 
- Risks and related challenges are also mentioned and response options are available.",5,"In terms of audit, overall I am quite satisfied with the information provided by the proposer, but there are a few details that I think it would be better to add more. For example, the proposer already provided milestones to measure project success such as video views, community comments, and shares, but I would suggest adding numbers here. I know it will be difficult to have an exact number to evaluate but we can take the data from previous Funds (eg Fund 7, 8) for reference and projection. This is also a way to help us track the successful progress through each stage of the different Fund. In addition, the communication channels of the project have also been listed clearly and publicly open so the community can check it.

The idea is to give users and projects that want to build on Cardano a tool that allows creating innovative websites through their plugin. Also creating videos as well as documentation to guide users more easily. CardanoPress's available plugins include: Adding Proposals, Installing Governance Plugin, Access By Stake Pool Delegation, etc. These plugins are quite convenient to help users build many things on their website. This creates practical support for projects on Cardano as well as positively affects the proposals submitted to Catalyst. The proposal that effectively addresses the goal posed by the challenge, is perfectly suited to this challenge.",5,"I agree on how to divide this project into phases. We will have 5 stages corresponding to different jobs performed. However, I think we should add timelines to do these work contents. At what time each stage will we start and how long its extension will take. I suggest that the proposer should detail information such as: how many documents are written, how many videos are created and respectively how many hours it takes to implement. This is like a plan with a specific roadmap that will help the project develop exactly the set plan, that is, a road has been built and we just need to go on that path.
About budget breakdown: in my opinion, it is not reasonable. The cost of $ 150 / hour in my opinion is quite high because the proposal only mentions the information of one people who will work on the project. So I'm implicitly saying that $150/hour is for 1 person instead of a group. Therefore, they create confusion for the community as well as the voter they can get the correct information. My suggestion for the project is to clarify how many people will do it and $150/hour will be paid for how many people. In addition, add other information such as the number of videos to produce, how many minutes each video will take to make the total time to only take 16 hours? Same goes for 8 hours of Documentation outline and structure.
The above suggested information will help the project increase the feasibility as well as the possibility of receiving funding will be higher. ",4,"I completely agree with the auditability of the project. Proposer provides excellent evidence on how we will check the information of the member working on this project. They inform about the project's website. We have a place to post metrics that are important in showing how successful this project is. The number of views will be statistics through google analytic to show usage => great. I have a small addition to the project's metric that is through the number of websites that integrate our plugin, for example, 3 months after the release of the document, the number will be 100 websites with the CardanoPress plugin.",5

The proposed content is to create an educational game about blockchain knowledge as well as Cardano. The game set will be put into universities to teach in order to popularize blockchain to students and graduate students. Through games, players will remember longer the knowledge that seems to be academic and hard to remember. At the same time, it creates curiosity for participants about blockchain technology as well as Cardano and then delves into this technology. The proposal also has plans to expand to other countries if this project is successfully implemented in Ecuador. The impact the project has had on Cardano has been overwhelming and I look forward to seeing the project come to life soon. ",5,"I appreciate the feasibility of the project. Aspects to evaluate include:
- Detailed plan: the proposed team has provided us with excellent and detailed information about the process of implementing this project. First we have time to mass produce the board game. Next we have a plan with each timeline that will approach the Colleges/Technical Institutes. A roadmap proved to be very systematic and I believe that the proposed team has prepared carefully for this plan.
- Budget breakdown: includes production costs and teaching costs. I am quite pleased with each specific expense explained. We have quantities and unit prices for each game set material. We have teaching hours and what is the average hourly wage. Very detailed here!
- Team experience: the instructor has a certain amount of experience in blockchain, and he is also a systems engineer so I believe in how he conveys this understanding to the surrounding community. In addition, the group has also organized more than 10 different blockchain educational events, so it will be a basis for evaluating the experience of organizing an educational session.
With all the above statements, I have given feasibility 5 points.",5,"I completely agree about the auditability of the project. The project's value creation must be accompanied by specific numbers. We have here 200 board games at 200 schools, 6000 players. Member information is public and verifiable through their profile page.

Especially towards Cardano becoming the best alternative to existing centralized providers, propose the team's idea: Organize exhibitions, large conferences for the Cardano community to share products developed on Cardano is essential and has positive implications for promoting the development of the Cardano Blockchain platform. So the issues you raised are relevant and of great importance to the F9 Challenge: Dapps, Products & Integrations. The idea proposed by the proposed team solved a number of questions of the Challenge such as: The actual product is a convention center, exhibition center, management system... Concurrent with this idea has also been directed towards ensuring that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to promote sustainable development, including, through education on sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles. sustainability, human rights, gender equality, promoting a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity and its contribution to sustainable development. Therefore, the proposal can be scaled up in the future, it helps to ensure public access to information and protect basic freedoms, in accordance with national laws and international agreements. . Furthermore, it also gives communities the opportunity to upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make them sustainable, increase resource efficiency, and adopt more technologies and processes. clean and environmentally friendly industrial processes, with all countries taking action in accordance with their respective capacities. Also from that noble goal, the proposed team set out the goal of Organizing the Cardano community in person, bringing this community to Conferences and increasing users and revenue 100 times. Furthermore, it will empower the community to accelerate the development of Cardano for all IOHK projects, dApps, NFTs and the entire crypto ecosystem. With this goal in mind, the team has clearly moved towards the development of quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transnational infrastructure, to support development. economic development and human well-being, with a focus on equitable and equitable access for all. The solution that the team offers also makes it easy for the community to access the product with a very simple and clear registration and selection process, which creates favorable conditions to help promote the development of the ecosystem. Cardano with Dapps and other products, let's all come together to represent and support the Cardano ecosystem, dApps and projects. I'm really impressed that you guys have given everyone a free $1,800 Synthetic Consensus card, held presentations at these events to communicate what Cardano is coming to. It can be seen that you have really convinced me by leading with practical evidence, so I appreciate the very appropriate, logical and intelligent argument of the proposed group. You've really mastered the game. More convincing evidence is that the proposal identified eight risks: Not having enough funding to meet demand. ADA and funding price volatility. Bad actor. Some conferences will not generate high ROI. International members will not be able to attend many of these conferences in the US and vice versa due to visa restrictions, travel costs, etc. Travel problems, visa restrictions, illnesses like Covid, and other complications. Not enough goods aka. SWAG to give away. This proposal is not funded. These are the risks in my opinion that any proposal may encounter in the process. However, I am very confident about your ideas in the implementation process when you have come up with solutions to control and overcome those risks: (1) Waiting list for the following funded proposal or Next year, looking for partners. (2) Convert all funding to Djed or Stablecoin. (3) using DID and cNFT Verified Credentials on Snapbrillia's Proof of Reputation system built on Hyperledger Aries and ATALA Prism. All verified cNFTs will be available for public inspection. This is a community effort with Snapbrillia closely tracking ROI. (4) Focus more funding on conferences that have previously generated high ROI for the dApps showcased there. (5) It is possible to organize exhibitions and conferences outside of the United States. (6) Incentivize ticket recipients to purchase travel insurance add-ons.(7) Snapbrillia has budgeted and will provide in-person attendees up to 1,000 super soft 100% cotton shirts. High quality featuring the Cardano Community logo and QR code designed by Snapbrillia's exceptionally talented design team. (8) napbrillia will likely still attend many conferences but likely won't exhibit to what we can afford to sponsor. With the risks and you mentioned, I believe the idea in your proposal will be a highlight to help the Cardano Blockchain system grow and attract developers as well as users.

",5,"The team's proposal defines the timeline by the number of events held during the month. And start the first event on August 27, 2022. Organizing community events to attract their interest, I personally think it is reasonable to organize such events as well as the frequency of such organization. In each event, the group also offers monthly exhibitions and conferences with corresponding themes towards the main content to raise awareness and create conditions for the community to have a great technology playground. To make each exhibition and conference event a success, the team aims to do the following: Create an exclusive Grow Cardano bounty at the Snapbrillia Conference for the Cardano community to sign up for conference and event tickets and pledge representation for Cardano. Fulfill four quarterly orders of 250 high quality super soft 100% cotton shirts featuring the Cardano Community logo and QR codes designed by the incredibly talented Snapbrillia design team. Next the team does the Linktr.ee upgrade to access Special Analytics. All work from preparation to implementation and the evaluation of the team's Exhibition and Conference results can be quickly and easily checked at the Ideascle proposals (link attached) and the testimonials themselves from the community copper. This shows that the group is very confident in the success of the plan that has been built as well as clearly shows the clarity and transparency in the implementation of the idea towards serving the community. With the schedule of organizing Exhibitions and Associations within more than 1 year with nearly 50 events, the group proposed a budget: 420000$ I think that is a reasonable number. That is also evident in the group's budget spending plan, which is very detailed at each event and other items such as: sponsorship of group tickets requested by the community, additional exhibitions and sponsorships. , Fees for minted Verified cNFTs, DID Credential Issue Fee, 1,000x high quality super soft 100% cotton shirt with Cardano Community logo and QR code, 2x Premium Linktr.ee Analytics. Although the proposal does not have a contingency budget, they have a very possible solution that is to encourage community cooperation. It is very smart that you have brought into play the power of the community to build ideas. And of course it also creates sustainability for the product when everyone in the community sees the rights and responsibilities there. To implement the idea of this proposal, the team consists of 5 key members and Dev team members (6 members + 80 support people), which is very powerful and very favorable conditions for the idea to become reality. real. You are also very attentive when there are specific assignments for members. All members and people involved have the capacity and experience appropriate to the task. The identities of all team members are authenticated on Linkedin.

",5,"The proposed group also provides specific metrics: Transparency and open funding processing. Keep track of 100x Revenue from Conference Exhibitions. Keep track of conference attendance and ambassadorship. Follow the impact of attending the conference and being a Cardano ambassador. Transparency and community involvement. You provide reasonable metrics for the Organization of an Event by monitoring and reporting on the number of participants, a key factor in determining the success of your proposal. Even better when all metrics are easily checked on Discord. However, the core success of the proposal is the Empowerment of the Cardano community to be an active Cardano ambassador and help launch more dApps and projects while strengthening the future of the entire Cardano ecosystem. Help current Cardano Ambassadors nurture the next generation of superstar Cardano ambassadors to grow the next, sustainable community. The team's Snapbrillia product was instrumental in building a platform that appealed to a million underrepresented and self-taught people about technology that would otherwise not have been able to break into the tech arena. This success has really ensured and oriented towards the criteria set by Challenge. The transparency of the proposal is also reflected in the fact that the group has had actual products running, has organized exhibitions and conferences attracting tens of thousands of people. The proposal is completely new but I believe that for a sustainable Cardano ecosystem it will be well received and supported by the community.

In the Proposal Assesor Guide is clearly stated that: “Proposers are now being prompted to give info on how they are working out their pay rates.” Which the proposers miss. For the lack of detail in the budget I have to take half a point also.

There could be a case where a certain dApp does not know that there is a possible way to migrate to a better environment or to one that suits it better, and that is definitely a communication problem.

8108,"F9: Dapps, Products & Integrations",500+ ₳Community Sent to Conferences,https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBzPv,z_assessor_2824,0,1,413992,26595,"We have here a proposal that aims to send the Cardano community / enthusiasts to various conferences this year as well as in 2023, and support Cardano focused presentations and attendance by Cardano-first teams. The proposal, although excellent in nature, would fit extremely well under the new Catalyst funding category “Community and outreach” currently being taken into consideration for future funding rounds, since its aim is to promote outreach efforts, bring in more people into the ecosystem and catalyze collaborations between existing projects and outside organizations. And this is an excellent use case with an already proven track record and idea validation. Ninh, the main proposer and founder of the Snapbrilla team, had already offered hundreds of free tickets to virtually attend this year’s Consensus event, with excellent feedback from the community. All you need to do to convince yourself of this is to go through the comments within the proposal - I have and this fact is quite obvious for me.  

Given the above mentioned context, I don’t think the proposal fits perfectly well within the challenge. Remember that the aim here is to build or integrate products that will offer more use cases to the Cardano ecosystem, drive adoption further and have a positive and permanent impact on overall adoption rates. Of course, with well crafted words one can definitely bring arguments in favor of the project’s inclusion in this challenge and not in another one, but given the broad diversity of projects and the fact the the Catalyst mechanism is very fluid and evolving, I will not be judging this aspect too harshly (only one star subtracting), also because the proposal is very solid in so many other aspects. ",4,"There are many upsides to the proposal that offer good and very good feasibility prospects. Let’s take them one by one. Firstly, there is an extensive list of events on the project’s radar, from August 2022 until late 2023, for which the project could support Cardano-specific presentations and facilitate the community’s presence, if funded. Most of them are already populated with target budgets for each individual event, but I believe it is understandable that this is not the case for all of them - since gathering pricing information depends greatly on data availability and it might be the case that for a part of the events the organizers simply haven’t disclosed pricing details just yet. 

Another interesting aspect of the proposal is that there is a very good acknowledgement of existing risks and ways to mitigate them. I will not be listing all of the risks presented in my review (and there are quite a few outlined), but I will provide a relevant example: to mitigate the volatility and currency risk (ADA devaluing, high volatility) the team intends to convert all funds received into a DJED or USDC stablecoin.  

Another area where the proposal shines is at the team presentation. We have extensive information regarding many of the proposers backing this project, and of course with many of the Snapbrilla team members present here. 

Let’s dive a little bit into the project’s budget. I was particularly impressed by the policy that transportation tickets shall not be covered by funding. I think this is a very positive attitude and a clear indication that we are dealing with a budget - conscious team. There are also extensive pieces of information regarding the budget’s construction, and we are definitely not lacking details here. However, in my view there is a certain lack of clarity and organization when presenting all the information. 

I do have a few points of improvement. In order for the proposal’s feasibility to have been an excellent one, I would have like to see it answering the following information: 

- offer a summarized version of the budget for conferences, with an easy answer to how much money goes overall towards presentations, and what (if any) mechanism is used if the demand for such presentations from the community exceeds the allocated budget. Also, will access to funds be available for other teams except Snapbrilla, if requested?

- we are offered an overall budget of 174k USD for community requested group tickets, but no further details. I would have liked to know, for instance, if we have a target discount in mind, since they will be negotiating bulk numbers? If yes, what happens if the discount will not be offered by organizers? Will the purchase be canceled if this is the case? Or perhaps an average price ticket per conference, or a target number of participants. Will purchases be refused if certain conferences charge an arm and a leg versus the value they bring and the networking opportunities they present? Sponsorships are also included in this caption - how much will they represent from the budget, and on which basis will these sponsorships be offered? ",4,"A great point of the proposal is that it uses qualitative indicators in order to assess the impact following each conference, for instance video testimonials, photos, as well as analytics where possible and of course, hard figures like number of tickets offered or headcount of attendance for the Cardano community. On top of this, there is a very clear choice of indicators with regards to tracking conference attendance, NFT minting and other perks involved, and the project offers a clear target of tickets / NFTs / etc. for each of the use cases. 

There will also be excellent transparency for blockchain transitions. Since the amounts requested will be held in DJED or USDC, the proposer argues that there will be full accountability towards the community, which is of course true. There is also an excellent use case of social media amongst the Cardano community since Snapbrilla is doing a very solid job in terms of having Telegram / Discord public servers in which the community can interact directly with the team in case of questions, doubts or simply asking for a free ticket to the next conference.

There are two worrisome points regarding the entire auditability section, which, albeit minor, are worth mentioning. First, there is no mention of the transparency of non-crypto transactions, and of course there will have to be numerous such transactions, since it is unlikely to be able to interact with all conference organizers exclusively via blockchain. 

Second, there is an interesting metric used throughout the proposal, but very prominent in the auditability section: the 100x revenue from conference. Even after carefully reading the explanations, I am not quite sure how to interpret the message behind the choice of words. Out of precaution, I would have preferred to see a more conservative term used (revenue enhancement, revenue increase) in order to steer clear of members that might perceive / associate the term in a “wen moon” context and take away from the project’s overall merits.

The proposal objectively fashion out these pain point in our daily lives and tries to bridge the gap.

The proposed solution intends to develop/build a robust App that will enroll various social and fun event centres like clubs, bars, restaurant, cinemas, pubs and other categories of similar fun services and users will be able to customize their preferences and receive notification of events happening in their preferred areas of choice. The proposer will leverage the Cardano blockchain to build a DApp that can be used for payment using ADA and other CNTs for services offered. These will open multifaceted opportunities for businesses as well as unlock real world usecase for Cardano.

It is expected that by the beginning of Nov. 2022, the website should be ready, public gitbook and native tokens although some dates provided in the proposal are conflicting but yet the proposer has an articulated, objective and a realistic timetable for execution and a conductible implementation plan. 
The proposer is requesting for a sum of $8936 but there is no budget breakdown that explain how that amount was arrived at although he claims that the proposed sum is to bootstrap the project but i suppose, an explanation will only better clarify the community. Also teams information is absent and void. I therefore have two concerns (No budget breakdown and no team details) which the proposer should try to make available in case they apply in future funding rounds.

-	This proposal brings together Digital Rights Management, Gamification, Incentivization, Ecommerce, ticketing, and social networking features all in one platform aiming to decentralize and disrupt the music industy by bringing labels, artists, event venues together
-	In doing so, it challenges the Cardano Ecosystem to provide tools needed for such innovations to materialize and also positions Cardano to compete with some recent products like Audius (https://audius.co/)  & the UtopiaMusic ecosystem (https://utopiamusic.com/)
-	The business model is clearly thought out and planned, and the big challenge is more about implementing features, scaling up rapidly. This can benefit from Cardano’s roadmap for scaling up from the Basho era features (https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/basho/)
",5,"-	The cost breakdown appears to be adequate and brings together competencies much needed at this stage ( technical, legal, customer experience design, project management and some marketing )
-	The longer term, vision and mission have been clearly explained. The roadmap and immediate objectives for this proposal with respective timeframes could be clarified. The team is not starting from scratch and if 70% of the application is already done in phase 1, and the focus is on completing the platform for go to market, in a phase 2, the budget may be adequate.
-	Some further details on the go to market strategy could help better understand if there may be some gaps in this respect, i.e marketing and communications campaign and gearing up with an operations team, business developers & partnership managers  to develop the partnerships needed. 
-	Setting up a business model canvas to explore an operating business model could highlight some other gaps or hypotheses that the team is making ( https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas) 
In order to accelerate time to value, the team could consider looking at some of the references below: 
Some developments in the Ethereum space with regards to royalty standards : 
-	https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981 - standard for royalties in Ethereum

-	Integration with lending protocols to faciliate liquidity for those purchasing rights to create content from artists or for manufacture of merchandise
o	https://www.meld.com/ from Cardano ecosystem
There are also some similar proposals in Fund9, so probably setting up a Cardano community focussing on the music industry, eg a Guild or even a consortium going forward could benefit everyone :

-	Perma-music rmNFT Marketplace, https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/415152
",4,"-	The team is clear on customer acquisition and adoption being the key outcomes they are after. As there is a go to market phase, having some indicators for feedback collection eg : number of users using it, number of interviews, ( groups, individuals) , feature requests using a user-voice mechanism , could be useful to gauge how well the product is being received and the potential for growing it into a mature product.
-	As this is an arts & entertainment space with active players the product needs to be solid and stable in order to develop the acquisition level it clearly deserves. Poor user experience could probably adversely affect growth, so some caution may be needed there. The team is rather experienced, so I would assume this is taken care of.
-	Nonetheless, some operational KPIs may be handy as the user-base scales, eg, some performance related metrics like number of crashes of application, outages, support requests and resolution rates. This could inform the sizing of the operations team needed as the application scales, and  I sincerely hope it will

o	Some articles from MIT that have talked about it (among many others out there) and clearly this is a problem from the legacy Web 2.0 world that needs solving
	https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/social-media-broken-a-new-report-offers-25-ways-to-fix-it

	https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-twitter-false-news-travels-faster-true-stories-0308 
o	Blockchain does indeed allow some avenues for “fixing” social media, and as the team suggests some principles from the Web 3.0 world can help : “visibility, governance, and incentivized participation”, that can lead to building accountability, veracity and weeding out misinformation and creating a safer social media space for all.
o	Cardano being a value based ecosystem, it is indeed a good fit do build such socially impactful solutions on Cardano to help make social media better and more accountable.
o	This initiative therefore fully fits in this Fund9 challenge and I would look forward to using the mainline platform in the future.
",5,"o	The team is indeed very well rounded with a diversity of profiles, technical, designers, legal and marketeers, which would reassure that they are up to the challenge. Some suggestions : 
	Capacity planning :
•	It may benefit the team to finetune the monthly capacity planning  , given the limited (7) staff count in order to be efficient, plan out the iterations needed map it out against deliverables ( UX, software, legal, marketing etc )
•	This may help highlight some gaps in terms of skills / capacity needed at specfic points in time where you could compensate using adhoc / freelance recruitments
	Product roadmap
•	Outstanding job so far in creating a beta product that is ready to scale in Q3-Q4 2022 with plenty of innovative features (paid community features, staking, curation, data marketplace etc )
•	Some suggestions that may be useful to meet the above objectives if you were to consider lean-startup/ design thinking concepts, would be to test out your hypotheses
o	Build a business model canvas for each of the key capabilities above, iron out the crypto-economics, focus on user experience and how you can integrate user feedback in the roadmap
o	Carry out some market research for users for the data marketplace, who are the customers, which kind of data do they need, what are the pain relievers and gain creators ?
o	Potentially focus on key customer segments ( Web 3.0 communities, investors ) as a priority and build for them, in order to control budget / timeline and product features that actually solve problems they have
•	Some resources that could be of interest for the classification of blockchain technolgies
o	https://www.blockchain.uzh.ch/publications/a-taxonomy-of-blockchain-technologies-principles-of-identification-and-classification/
o	Integration with Certik.com for security considerations

",4,"o	The KPIs mentionned are mostly activity/ community related which is great and the key objective of launching on Cardano is also commendable. In order to be able to align the KPI metrics against the funding and roadmap suggested, it may be helpful to identify activity v/s outcome metrics on a monthly / quaterly basis.
	For staking for example, you could use launchpads like Cardashift, Revuto and emit specific staking volumes for funding
	Some numbers around community acquisition and engagement metrics can also be helpful to evaluate the financing that you may need at specific periods to acquire audience, which could be via townhalls, discords, conference presentations etc
	Some metrics therefore around how much effort will be invested in audience acquisition can also help evaluate whether the current marketing / sales strategy is working or needs to be adapted.

The proposal for Decentarlized Social Intellegence describes a data tool for social media that helps to get a clearer view on authentizity of the social media profiles and also a makro view on ongoing topics and conversations. The use case is described clear and with much detail so the voter can see what goals want tob e reached and how the application works and can help to provide support with real life problems or inefficencies. Fort he cardano blockchain and the challenge setting this proposals shows clear support for social media topics and fits good in the portfolio. One point that could be added would be why cardano is a better choice than other blockchains so that the reader connects better with the project and see´s the advantage.

Competitor:
As Data tools for social media are already pretty common, there is a clear risk that there are already other tools on the market that solve the same problem. E.g. Google has an analizing tool for years in existence. This is an important point that needs tob e addressed by the project team and is unfortunatly missing.

Link to challenge setting and other challenge settings:
The link to the challenge setting is given, as this project is build to create data support for social media purposes and therefor fits good in this category. Also a DAO is beeing developed so things can be integrated on an open source and decentralized way that supports the guidance of Cardano and Catalyst. 

Risks:
Two risks are written down that can be seen as important by the prject team. The bear market and platform APIs. As the second risk is clearly given the first risk mentioned should not be too important for a project that wants to get funded. The reason for the funding process is to give support tot he teams so they don´t need to look at such pirce-market-conditions. Other more important risks are unfortunately missing and should be added to give the voter a 
better overview of bulletpoints that need to be considered.
",4,"Showing of realistic timetable:
There is a quarterly timetable with clear written milestones that show a good overview. As there are also finished points written down, it can be seen that the timetable is rather realistic and can be achieved. For such a big project a more detailed timetable with deadlines fort he subproject would be beneficial so the reader/voter can gain more confidence and the picure is even more professional.

Budgetfit:
The budget break down is stated clearly and realistic and seems to fit to the goals and ToDo´s that are written down. To give transperancy fort he auditability part a more detailed budget is always welcome so KPIs and milestones can be controlled in an easier way.

Motivation/drivers:
Unfortunately there is no clear statement about the project teams motivation rather than trying to give a value add tot he cardano community. The structure of the DAO and their coin $MAIN incentivises the project team to be successful and get things done in time to drive value of the project. Also external drivers and early supporters are mentioned on their website so ther are parties pushing for success which can be seen rather positive. 

Teammembers and experience:
All teammembers LinkedIn profiles are tagged so the voter can get easy information on the background of the people working on the project. There are clear structures and task sharings so it is likely that the team operates efficient. A nice to have would be some additional words on the teams experience together so the voter can gain even more confidence on the success.
",5,"KPIs and goals:
There are clear written KPIs that the voter and the community can track the success against. The KPIs are written towards the application growth and there operational success rather than the project milestones and development success. This should be added to not only have an external view on the projects success but also an internal look so problems or issues can be seen early stage and tackled before they become critical. 

Communication channels and audits:
Unfortunately there is no clear mentioned communication channel fort he community to get access to their development and success. The growth of the KPIs could be shown interactive on the webside. This would be a big plus to gain more confidence a show a glass clear vision of transperency of the project.

By having their movies translated into different languages, the proposal aims to help Asians for whom English is not their first language and help them feel more at ease while learning about a proposal. Additionally, this can help proposers reach out to Asian voters. They may simply upload their proposals as videos to any social network as live proposals thanks to the video, which will act as a marketing tool for them and let people see who is behind the proposal and establish confidence.

This is a continuous proposal that has received funding through Fund7. To date, 38 videos have been produced, resulting in the funding of more than half of these proposals.

Cardano is missing a resource to send community members to in-person conferences. This proposal aims to send Cardano community members to in-person conferences to accelerate the growth of Cardano. Many community members lack the funds needed to go to these events as prices for tickets can go upwards of 1000 dollars, 
These large events offer more than just parties and drinks. It allows the Cardano network to grow. It can also be life-changing for individuals attending them. Conferences are great for making connections, and gaining knowledge, and gives you a general idea of where the industry is going. Some people even find jobs at these conferences!. These conferences also serve as great marketing for the Cardano community as a whole. For example, the Consensus conference this year had thousands of visitors. Having great community members at that conference shows the world what Cardano is up to.
The proposal also explained to us ways they will be able to scale in the future. They will find additional partnerships or sponsorships to fund this, participate in future catalysts funds, and as well as donations from community members. 
	Community is what is going to drive Cardano forward and this proposal is all about community, I can’t really think of any other chain that has something similar to this. This proposal if funded will show people how much Cardano cares about its members. 
",5,"	This proposal has provided more than enough evidence that it can deliver the things it says it will. It is asking for 500,000 to purchase tickets for Cardano community members. They listed all the major events they plan to send them to alongside details on how much funds they are going to allocate to each individual event,
The team at Snapbrillia and the team at TheHIddenOrder will be working together on this. Both Snapbrillia and TheHiddenOrder have team members with years of industry experience. Snapbrillias Ceo/Co-Founder is Ninh Tran who previously co-founded the industry-leading ATS system HireEz. The founder of TheHiddenOrder is Timothy Vang who was previously a project manager working with organizations such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Red Cross to bring vaccines to over 13 million people in Tokyo. 
	They also listed many potential challenges they might face and how to mitigate them. One major challenge they bought up was the potential of bad actors snatching up free tickets to sell or using a bot to take all the tickets. They are planning to launch this service on Snapbrillias bounty network that was previously funded in Fund 8. Their bounty network will have Atala Prisms DIDs incorporated in them for identity verification and have ticket recipients meet them before or at the conference to get their tickets. The team that is behind this proposal, the fact that they understand the challenges ahead of them and proposed solutions to them, and their proven record all give me confidence that the proposal will be implemented once it is funded. 
",5,"	This proposal has provided a sufficient number of ways for community members to audit its progress once it gets funded. They have clearly listed all the events they plan to send community members to as well as the major milestones they wish to achieve. Their major milestone is sending 500-1000 people to conferences. They also provided ways to prove that they actually gave those tickets out by having Video/Photo testimony as well as a write-up by all ticket recipients. 
	They are going to do demos and progress updates in After Town Halls bi-weekly or at least once per month. During the breakout rooms in the Town Hall meetings, community members can directly ask the co-founders and core team members any questions they have. They did this and are still doing this with their previously funded proposals. They are also super active in the Catalyst community. Their team members can always be seen in the Catalyst Town Hall meetings. 
	They are active on social media. In the proposal, they posted links to all of their social media channels. I am on their discord server and many of their core team members are active on it. Any community member at any time can hop onto their discord server and ask them about their progress. They are very transparent and open about where they are currently.

The proposal wants to increase the circulation of strategic content about EVM on Cardano by translating articles and documents into 3 languages in English, Portuguese and Spanish. Make it easier for the worldwide ETH community to access the EVM and get the mobility needed. Therefore the proposal is suitable for the Challenge
The documents, and in-depth articles on EVM, though less attractive to the community, are very necessary and important for developers and dApps who want to move or expand interactivity. The proposal was intended to promote the dissemination of translations by tagging the translated content in the author's publication, taking advantage of the number of people who interact. Documents are translated into 3 languages, increasing readability by developers. And the proposal will create social networking links to regularly update translations. This is a good idea, please provide a specific link for the community to monitor and monitor
On the risk side, the proposal lists three problems, all of which have solutions attached. I appreciate this. Then I have a suggestion. This is a non-profit project for users, translations should be sent to Cardano, ETH, developers, and investment communities. This will help to make the translations widely available.
I really appreciate the impact the proposal brings. 5 absolute points for this part
",5,"The proposal is carried out for 6 months with the processes listed in detail. After consulting, I found the timelines to be appropriate to get the job done. However, can the proposal provide some links to the reports, original documents, and data sources that the proposal intends to translate? This helps the community consult and support recommendations to identify sources as trustworthy.
The team has only 2 members, but after I consulted the links the proposal provided, I appreciated their competence and experience. All are very suitable for the implementation of the proposal. So with the support of $2,080/month for each member, the total budget for 6 months is $25,000 ~ 5% of the total Challenge fund, these numbers are reasonable. There is only one small suggestion, you should divide the budget by working hours, everything will be more detailed and intuitive. I rate 5 points for this part
",5,"Articles and translations are two visual indicators that are easy to quantify. The community can follow. However, the 3 KPIs under [AUDITABILITY] What does success for this project look like? should be posted [AUDITABILITY] Please describe what you will measure to track your project progress and how will you measure them? Would be more suitable. Those are very important metrics to gauge the actual success of the proposal. You should also update the separate gitbook link for the proposal so that the community can monitor and check the progress.
As for [AUDITABILITY] What does success for this project look like? You can present the following, the success of the project will help many dApps that have the need to move or expand from the ETH ecosystem to Cardano easily, thereby increasing the number of Cardano users, and contributing to building a Sustainable, growing ecosystem.

The team plans to make short videos which will inform and educate people about Cardano and project  catalyst. Giving Proposers a platform to sell their ideas to both voters and PA in a language they understand through 5 minutes videos on Catalyst TV is a step in the right direction. The proposal effectively addresses the challenge and for that matter I will give it a 5 star rating.,5,"The experience of the proposer matches the plan set forth in the proposal. Making at least 40 short videos before voting sessions begin is achievable. 

The budget presented however is a bit ambiguous. The budget amount quoted seems to cover for both Fund 9 and Fund 10. I suggest that the proposer focuses on completing whatever task he intends to within the space of time available in fund 9 before accessing another fund to continue the project in Fund 10.
This proposal is highly likely to be implemented successfully when funded. This is why I think it deserves a 4 star rating ",4,"The proposer has given very clear milestones and key metrics with which progress and success can be audited easily. 

The catalyst community will be able to track progress of this project by checking on the number of videos posted per week on Catalyst TV. Additionally the number of views and subscribers will help the catalyst community to determine the success of this project. The information provided is adequate to audit the progress and success of this proposal and for that matter I will give it a 5 star rating ",5

Before moving on to using Plotly/Dash, I used WordPress for building websites. The thing I enjoyed about it was the plugins. Plugins are what makes WordPress go. It is super easy to install and run a plugin on WordPress. The proposer has built a plugin to integrate Cardano into WordPress. This means that anyone can connect web3 functionality i.e. Cardano wallets, to their WordPress websites. He is now proposing to develop documentation and create tutorials to assist inexperienced developers to “pick out code ot start building”

This project can attract developers from other languages and current WordPress users to start building on the Cardano ecosystem. Since most inexperienced developers from other languages will not simply dive into Plutus and/or Haskell , the Cardano community will benefit from such an easy on ramp.This may also be the starting point to encourage some developers to start learning Plutus and/or Haskell. This project can reach an international audience as people all over the world use WordPress.

This is in line with the challenge metrics because the number of Cardano developers will increase creating more products which will lead to onboarding more users.",5,"The budget is straightforward and clearly broken down with the main costs being an hourly rate for the content creator.

The proposer is a prominent content creator on YouTube. His channel has 14k subscribers and has 265 videos. A good thing is that the proposer already has a working product and there is also a 30min tutorial on how to install and set up the CardanoPress plugin on WordPress. This conveys credibility and confidence that documentation and tutorials will be successfully created.",5,"A detailed plan of the proposal is included however no timeline is given.The proposer should have included a date or time frame for every phase indicated. 

The proposer provides two main sources in which the project can be audited. One of them is a link url where the completed product will be, This is good but a timeframe should have been included so that the community knows when the document will be completed.

It has been made clear which team members are needed to carry out this project. The budget is very clearly defined. You can clearly see where the funding will go. For some conferences the budget has yet to be discussed. A lot of money has already been saved because everyone will cover their own transport, plane tickets. The budget is certainly sufficient to carry out everything. It's good that the team is open to collaborating with other existing projects. No additional funding will be requested as snapbrillia will be completely self-sufficient and profitable. A realistic timetable has been included to conduct all conferences, hackathons and events.

The most important thing will be as discussed in the proposal to be very transparent towards the community. The team has ensured that the community can keep a close eye on everything. (social media, conferences,.. ) The petitioner has given a clear description of how he will grow the Cardano community and help ongoing projects.

The problem is that the new Dapps built on Cardano lack the market marketing resources to bring the community to the conferences and grow by 100x users. Community is one of the most valuable resources and also a resource that contributes to the rapid development of any project or ecosystem. The Cardano Community is a decentralized global community.
The solution of this proposal is described in detail and clear and the method of reasoning is rigorous. The solution is to exhibit at major industry conferences with free tickets for the Cardano community to share the Cardano gospel. The author used photographs, and evidence from previous successful events (such as Consensus) to demonstrate the importance of the exhibits. Apparently, the effects of the exhibits are great for Cardano. The author has also described the registration process and the selection process of the participants in great detail. Meeting in person at Cardano conferences, events, and exhibitions will be an extremely impactful Proof of Community for those inside and outside of Cardano.
I found that the author's proposed solution met the challenge because it had enough things to join the challenge (""Many others - Any other idea, product, or integration that someone thinks should be built into the Cardano ecosystem"") and solve the problems of the challenge (increasing number of users, number of meaningful interactions...)
In addition, the team has outlined the main risks that may be encountered when implementing this project and they also have appropriate solutions to minimize these risks.",5,"The proponent provided a detailed plan. Here's a schedule of upcoming exhibitions, conferences, hackathons and events with clear timelines and links for the community to easily sign up for. In addition, some other work was done such as: creating an exclusive Grow Cardano bonus at the Conference on Snapbrillia for the Cardano community to register for conference and event tickets and commit to representing Cardano; order 1000 shirts and upgrade Linktr.ee to access Special Analytics.
The proposed budget of $420,000 represents 5.35% of the total Challenge budget. This money is allocated for specific conferences as the author presented in the proposal and detailed allocation for other expenses such as: Sponsoring group tickets requested by the community, additional exhibitions supplement and sponsor; cNFTs minting fees; DID authentication fee; the cost of ordering 1,000 shirts; Linktr.ee upgrade fee. The author also explained the proposed amount and budget allocation.
Information about the members of the implementation group is described in full and in detail by the author. They are all experienced and competent in implementing AI and Blockchain solutions in Healthcare Tech, FinTech, E-Commerce, Legal, Non-Profit and HR Tech. They have run AI and Web3 startups. In addition to this proposal, they have a number of other proposals also submitted in Fund 9 and they also have proposals funded from previous Funds. In addition, the author has also provided a link to the members' personal profiles for the community to easily verify their identities.",5,"The team planned to handle the funding transparently and publicly by holding it in a DJED or a publicly available stablecoin wallet for the community to check at any time.
The author has provided metrics and KPIs to track the project's progress in 3 different aspects (tracking 100x revenue from conference exhibitions; tracking conference attendance and being an ambassador; tracking the impact of attending the conference and serving as a Cardano ambassador)
The author outlined how they increased transparency and increased engagement with the community. For example: hold a Snapbrillia & Progress Demo behind City Hall at least once to twice a month and attend most Catalyst Town Halls to capture community feedback and input. In addition, they will provide the latest information and updates on the project's Discord channel.
The team defined the success of the project very clearly. This project aims to empower the Cardano community to be an active Cardano ambassadors and help launch more dApps, projects, and strengthen the future of the entire Cardano ecosystem. Also help current Cardano Ambassadors nurture the next generation of superstar Cardano ambassadors to grow the community.",5

I still wonder who will be qualified to be on the examiner board and what is the evaluation criteria?
The main risks are predicted and followed by some addressing approaches. The risks are mostly generated from the team itself so there is a need to have a clear plan. For example, what is the promotion plan (that has specific steps) to get more participants in case there are few people joining the project? What might be the problem if the project has to switch to an online event? Does it have negative impacts on the project’s results in general?

The budget breakdown is well described in the proposal. The number is clear and reasonable, supporting the community to follow and track the costs. There is also cohesion between the action plan and fund distribution, which indicates the plausibility of the spending. 
The proposers have described the team members effectively with descriptions of their backgrounds and relevant experiences.

The success goals are specific and realistic (e.g. at least 5 groups sign up and 120 people join the event), helping the team to stay focused and effectively execute the project. However, the team should mention how these results will be reported to the catalyst community? If they are updated after the event’s time, how can the community track the progress?

Having a music streaming platform for product distribution and monetization is not an uncommon idea nowadays, as there are such big names currently dominating the market, for instance, Apple Music, Spotify, Deezer, Tidal or Soundcloud, etc. However, integrating NFTs and a blockchain into the platform, I believe, has yet to be mainstream and well-received. Therefore, DM could become a fresh change of pace for the wide variety of users out there, especially those interested in cryptocurrency and blockchains. And not only will DM be a marketplace for NFT-based sales and purchase between parties, but it will also be somewhat a social media platform as well, boasting social elements to create a community where artists and producers can interact with their followers, and followers can express their support and admiration by purchasing their favorite works. 
I’m excited to see that DM will welcome all kinds of art creators, from independent artists to even firms and labels, all of which seem to be suitable target audiences. And for those who have just discovered their newfound interest in NFTs and the Cardano blockchain, the team has also hosted events and tours where there will be demonstrations of the project and Cardano itself, and created a series of educational Youtube videos introducing Cardano for new audiences. A very thoughtful move in my opinion. And the fact that the team’s previous CNFT project Jazz Is Dead and the proposal for this project have recently been featured on Cardano Ecosystem News is a promising sign of things to come, at the same time further spreading DM to potential users. 
I’m delighted to know that DM has reached a 70% rate of completion before this proposal to Catalyst, meaning all the fundamental elements have been made readily up and running with the team’s very own budget and only the implementation of CNFT and blockchain features is needed. Personally, I would prefer that the team had included that 70% development process and what took place at each stage, since that would better demonstrate the features DM has and offer more clarity as well. 
Considering that the team has finished 70% of the project on their own, getting the funding for the remaining 30%, which is to integrate the blockchain-based functionalities into the platform, is undoubtedly a main concern for the proposers. Though I am not the one with the final verdict, I’m confident that the team should be able to seal this funding.
However, as for the other challenges of lacking the knowledge of Cardano and its development tools to perfectly execute said functionalities and not possessing a strong enough server to host various artists at the same time, the team has not offered up any viable resolutions. I suggest that the proposers should quickly include those solutions, since these brought up challenges seem quite critical to the foundation of the final product.",3,"As mentioned above, 70% of the project has been completed, so It’s natural that the completed features be experimented in the BETA test. 
For the roadmap to deliver the CNFT marketplace implementation, the proposal has managed to enumerate all the elements of its marketplace website, each page comes with respective functions and errands, though not too detailed. Personally, I would love to see a timeline for this phase to determine how long it would take from start to finish and when a serviceable MVP could be released to the public.  
For the requested budget, It will be divided amongst 4 different sectors of the project and also one portion will be assigned to the payment of the blockchain dev team. I think that this section could use a bit more information regarding what would take shape in each sector and how much it would cost for each installment to better clarify the requested funding.

As for the participating members of the project, though the proposal does give me the names and respective positions, there’s still a lot to be desired for this section, as I believe that the community would love to know more about the relevance of the team, for example, applicable expertise, educational backgrounds and past experiences. It would be even more convenient to verify them if there were some sorts of visual evidence or dedicated profiles. Another noticeable detail is that apparently there is no individual whose specialty is Cardano and its development tools, as specified in the Impact section that the team still lacks, however, the team has not made any announcements about the recruitment of such a crucial position.",2,"As far as auditability is concerned, I believe that by using project tracking tools like JIRA, Github and Slack to keep tabs on progress and milestones, there is some level of clarity achieved here. Nonetheless, I would love to see some more information on the utilization of said tracking tools, for example, will the data be accessible for internal involved parties only or will they also be available for the outside community to have a look at as well? Or perhaps how long periodically will they post the progress, updates or changes of the project?
The envisioned success of the project for the team includes the adoption of artists and music lovers to Cardano and multiple transactions being made on a fully functional music streaming platform where users can not only enjoy music but also interact with one another. This is undoubtedly what the proposers set out to achieve, which aligns well with the required scope of success of this Challenge. Yet, once again, It would be beneficial for the team to include key metrics for measurement and estimated figures of adoption and transactions to describe a possible scenario of desirable outcome, further solidifying the proposal.",2

I am afraid not; their target customers are quite different from Cardano and our community at present is suitable for service industry only, particularly gaming or cryptocurrency...That is why the author only mentions one successful case - Consensus event which is an ideal place of community, builders and innovators so if you want go further, we need more evidence to see the impact in other industries. Particularly in this part, they quoted from many people in blockchain community, who will certainly support the idea of organizing a party for crypto, what me and other investors want to hear there are feedbacks from people in other major industries to see the possibility of this project.

I also see something noted TBA; from my personal opinion, if you are unclear about something, please do not put it there as investors can ask you to clarify; for instance why you pick Hackathon Seatle not Hackathon New York. About team members, they are diversified from lecturer to CEO and developers but it is clearly they miss some core factors such as finance consultant and event planner. How can you participate big events without a planner and hope to balance or even raise fund without a consultant?",3,"For this part, it looks good because the author indcates several ways to evaluate the project coming from various sources such as exhibitors, attendee, social media...To be honest, I do believe Cardano will get more attentions and chances to develop if they attend approriate events (not all industries for sure) but the project mission to have more ambassadors is still vague and depend on many factors, not everyone invited to the exhibition is willing to become Cardano superstar so the author needs to discuss more closely on the inviting list to have the best result. Also, I do not know where they copy the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Rating but do not write all there and just pick the suitable one / most relevant one to your challenge to avoid confusion. Turning to their related proposals before, what a miss that no projects talk about how to raise fund and how to organize the event successfully so even I know they are serious with this proposal, they still have no needed experience to implement it.",3

The proposer has shown us clearly how their project is going to impact the Cardano ecosystem by creating adoption and community around music with live streaming, digital music sales/streaming, physical merchandise sales & a CNFT marketplace. The team has already started landing a solid foundation for their project by completing 70% of the application and beginning educating users on their Youtube channel. They want to build decentralized music, live streaming and a CNFT music marketplace that aims to allow the artist and the fan to engage in a way that may not have been possible before, this proposal is very ambitious and I can see how it’s going to bring a massive adoption to the Cardano ecosystem. With the promise of being at jazzisdead.co and aligning their launch with over 30 events and tours they are producing from now into fall 2022, I can see so much potential in this proposal. I can see how this proposal addresses the challenge as it’ll help generate a funnel for adoption and education for artists and musicians into the Cardano ecosystem and also serve as a boutique resource hub for musicians interested in engaging in Web3 solutions on Cardano. The artist and label will be able to retain an e majority share of all transactions. Bringing all aspects of musical commerce to one platform. Hence, the project will almost certainly attract so many users (musicians, producers and audiences) to our ecosystem, contribute to the development of the CNFT music market in general and benefit Cardano.

Since most of the budget object is explained in terms of categories like legal, and marketing, … I think it’s important to break it down into relevant required working hours. Otherwise, it’s almost impossible to justify the requested fund. Moreover, the team requested 110,000k which is higher than the challenge’s budget, hence it’s even more important to show an explanation for this exceeded amount.

The team should build clear key metrics for this project and better with time-related KPIs, which can be regarding the number of new users joining, the number of new artists joining and posting their work, the sale of CNFT creation and so on.

The solution is also obvious: create adoption and community around music via live streaming, digital music sales/streaming, physical merchandise sales & a CNFT marketplace. In detail, the proposers will introduce the community to DecentralizeMusic.com (DM), which is a live streaming platform that also allows artists to create profiles, sell their merchandise, music and NFTs. I like the overall idea and wish the team the best of luck. The authors of this also foresee some obstacles implementing the project but the possible actions to address them seem not sufficient to me. Furthermore, it would be interesting to clarify the objectives for each statistic in order to quantify the impact. This proposal would gain greater support from voters if the proposers could provide additional detail on what I just said.",3,"Unfortunately, the proposal fails to include not just a description of the team's talents and experience, but also a reference to back them up. The author of this proposal might consider giving the community a description of the individuals' talents and expertise, as well as links to further LinkEd, YouTube channels, or Twitter accounts to define who they are. According to my understanding, the project is 70% complete, and the team is looking for support for phase 2. Given the plan provided, it is unclear whether the proposal will be successful. Despite the fact that there is a description of the implementation plan, which allows readers to comprehend the tasks required. Unfortunately, the team did a poor job of giving a timeline and milestones for each stage of the project, and there was no mention of a deadline for the solution, making it difficult to determine whether it could be completed in a certain amount of time. I would have preferred it if the team had offered an overview of what may have been accomplished in three, six, or twelve months (for example). The team requests a total of $110,000 in funding. The budget is divided into five components, the majority of which will be allocated to the legal field. In order to fully understand the budget allocation, I feel that more specifics in a budget breakdown would be desirable. In other words, the proposers could consider breaking each element into more identifiable items. I mean, for instance, $25.000 for marketing still leaves room for imagination. Its cost is quite higher than that of other proposals in the field of Marketing. Additionally, I advise the team to detail the development expense, such as how many working hours will be divided among how many employed individuals, etc.",2,"In terms of auditability, the team promises to track progress and milestones using project management tools such as JIRA, Slack, and github commits. It would be preferable to establish a platform or channel of communication between the team and the auditors. To quantify auditability in a structured and systematic manner, I would advise that the proposer provide considerably extra detail about the project's development and process. It would be really advantageous if we could see a clear path with milestones and an expected timeframe. I would also recommend incorporating some success measures in order to track progress. For example, how many people are expected to join after a certain time period.",2

As the proponent mentions, CardanoPress is the previous tool they created, and this time is asking for funding so they can continue building the documentation for it. I'm not questioning the quality of this proposal, I'm just wondering if developing a tool and then releasing the comprehensive documentation that comes with it is the responsibility and the right thing to do from the moment the tool/product comes into operation or there is any change in function/operation. Why are proponents calling for funding to continue to develop additional documentation for their products at this point, and what effect does the lack of documentation have on the quality of their current CardanoPress tool operation or not.",3,"Although the project development plan is divided into several sub-phases to make it easier to manage and track tasks, the proponent has also made an effort to estimate the time required for each task, but it lacks specific dates/months to determine when work is completed and documentation is released. The proposed budget allocation plan is estimated based on the number of hours worked by the team and is relatively consistent with the description of the implementation of the plan. Because the main job of this project is to write the documentation for their own product, no one could be a better fit than its creator. Overall, the quality of the documentation is not something to worry about.",3,The outlines of success described here are more about the proponent's perspective than the commitment to the positive impact the project will have on Cardano. We need to have a clear roadmap of timelines and KPI projections expressed in specific numbers so that experts can assess the potential impact of the project on Cardano is worth invest or not. The plus is that the proponent provided the community with a tool to track their performance reports.,3

I have been using social media since 2005, when social media was used only for interacting with friends. Back in 2005 there was no question whether a profile was managed by a human or not. It usually was, but nowadays things have changed. 
Social media have become a platform of politics and advocacy campaigns. Often with the help of bots, like how a foreign country had an impact on the 2016 presidential election in the US. 
This dapp could be the solution to this problem. The website looks solid and trustworthy. It was very easy to register an account. In the dapp, users can select what information they want to get a live feed on. Users can also select if they want to show posts that are from verified accounts only. There are lots of more filters to apply all in order to get rid of trolls and bots from the users feed. 

The DAO uses the MAIN token to get capital in order to cover the costs of storing huge amounts of data. The idea is that instead of ads the token will be used for sustainability without a third party involvement. Users can stake tokens and setup a stream of information that they think will go viral. The proposal also takes the ongoing bear market in account as one of the main risks with the project. The proposers do think that the use case of the DAO will override the bear market and get investors anyway. 

This proposal provides a strong use case in the form of a social media x-ray vision as the proposers call it, that filters out trolls and bots. 
",4,"Given the experience of the seven team-members presented in this proposal and that the website is already up and running, it is highly likely that the proposal will be implemented successfully. The timeline is well presented with key milestones. First three milestones have already been reached, with the latest to be the open alpha for the platform. 
However, there are little to none challenges and risks notified in the timeline. If there would be any kinds of challenges presented in the timeline, this would provide a more thoughtful presentation.

The budget is outlined clearly with database upgrades as the biggest piece. The budget presents further social media integrations such as reddit and instagram. The budget also presents staking rewards. Although the budget is thorough and well presented.

The idea is logical and appears it would be an incredible way to grow the influence of Cardano beyond what it is now. It would do this by bringing the passion and energy of ADA fanboys to a much larger and broader community. I would give this a 5, but it doesn’t fit perfectly within the challenge goals.

This will not only have the effect of improving Cardano’s PR for a year or so, it will help to evaluate the impact of attending each conference. There will be measures for how much growth each attender experiences for their project. It will measure how many people are interacted with, and through media it will measure how large of an impact ADA team members made at the conference.

First, I would reframe the identified risk of “not getting enough funding to take it to market.” This might make voters think that this project built 70% of the platform without proper preplanning to ensure it reaches completion and is now in need of a bailout, which is not a good start to an investment. I also feel like I am missing a sense of magnitude that is brought by market research, following reports, and disclosure of reputable partnerships. The size of the impacts section is measured by how many people a project could reach, whether that be artists, listeners, social media followers, and/or talent agents. So as far as the impression that I get for the impact/cost ratio, I am neutral on whether or not I think that it is worth the $110k request. ",3,"For lack of detail on core team member’s experience, elaboration needed on budget, and inefficient use of roadmap space, I rank this section a 2. Voters will want relevant information easily accessible and this proposal does not give anything for the core development team other than their name and role with this project. If the purpose of this section is to evaluate the chances of this proposal feasibly seeing success, it is essential that the voters know what the experience and capabilities of the team to carry it out. On the roadmap, there is a lot of wasted space here (in part, because of the double spacing of every line). The substance provided in this section for is a little less relevant for what the voters need. This roadmap provides every aspect and detail of what needs to be built on the platform but we really just need a timeline for how long each section needs to be built. This roadmap needs more information on timeframes and hours of labor required as well. The budget is the least of this sections problems but it is still an issue that it doesn’t thoroughly breakdown how each category is being spent. While it only allocates amounts to different categories, voters will need to see hourly rates and how many hours of labor is allocated to each category so that voters can determine if the funds are being spent efficiently. Overall, this section has some easy fixes and it does have to do some restructuring on the roadmap to better inform voters. ",2,"Due to lack of objective target metrics, I rank this proposal a 1. This auditibility section generally talks about where they track progress and what defines success for them but they do not disclose what objective metrics they want to be seeing in these areas. It seems like the only measure of success here is the completion of the application in its planned capabilities. There is room to add more KPIs like social media engagement, Github engagement, user base, created artist profiles, website traffic, and whatever other creative metrics that might provide voters with a sense of confidence that the project has objective goals. I give bonus points for proposals that give these metrics in a timeframe format that show milestones at each point. I think these changes will provide massive improvements in the eyes of voters. ",1

The community is always diverse, no one is the same. People like to read, people like to listen, and people like to watch videos with visual images. I appreciate the way you convey the content of the proposals to the community through short interviews with the proponent of the proposal. This is a smart way to deliver content. It not only gives the community concise and concise information but also creates trust for the community to help voters easily make accurate decisions. In addition, the interview has been translated into languages of East Asian countries, helping to further develop this community.""

“Now the proposals are all written in English. Thus, many voters in East Asian countries, especially those that have not or are developing, will have difficulty understanding the proposal. Your solution to the challenge is very promising. Helping the East Asian community to develop more and more. In addition, I find your interview videos very valuable in terms of quickly disseminating knowledge to the community. So if you add a solution to get your videos to more people, it will be very convincing.”

“Short videos are a good idea, but they also come with risks and challenges. I completely agree that the risks you take are that the video may take longer than expected and that the deep technical issues are difficult to convey accurately. However, if an interview lasts longer than 1 video due to technical problems that are too difficult to understand, you can split it into several videos to make the content of the interview complete. You should also choose proposals that are not too technically complicated to implement. Another risk that I would recommend is that you can't control the interviewee's personality, sometimes the poor preparation of the interviewee will ruin your interview.""

The project is the goal of future scale development, exhibitions and conferences are organized to bring the Cardano community closer together. Exhibitions and conferences are the place to meet the cardano community in person, bringing this community to conferences and increasing users and revenue by 100 times. It's great to join us easily sign up and the selection is very simple and clear. The solution helps drive the development of the Cardano ecosystem with Dapps and other products, all of which represent and support the Cardano ecosystem, dApps development, and projects. The project organized to give people a $1,800 composite consensus card for free, holding presentations at these events to communicate what Cardano was about to launch. The solution makes appropriate arguments for how to solve the stated problem. The proposal identifies 8 risks: There is not enough funding to meet demand. ADA and funding price fluctuations. Bad actors. Some conferences won't produce high ROI. International members will not be able to attend many of these conferences in the United States and vice versa due to restricted visas, travel costs, etc. Travel problems, illness such as Covid, and other complications. Not enough goods aka. SWAG to give. We can see that the project author has taken into account a lot of risks and has also taken appropriate mitigation measures.

The manner in which cardano's proposed real impact is unclear, Wedsite seems to be aiming for commerciality to be the main, at live-streaming events cardano may be introduced, but how to do this has not yet been stated. The challenge of creating a valuable Dapp depends on the impact on the user, the goal of the proposal is directed at musicians and audiences but has not yet shown a real impact on these audiences. We can see the proposal that facilitates musicians bringing works to the public and making money from them.

I think this project is quite nice and has the potential to be applied in practical, adding significant value to the Cardano ecosystem, because 3D printing technology is a global trend, and widely used in recent years. The additional functions in the marketplace are associated with scientific and technological developments in popular and prominent fields. I am impressed with the solution that combines the SmartContract feature with the NFT marketplace on a Decentralized platform, the team is aiming to build a pretty perfect system on the Cardano ecosystem.",4,"Unfortunately, the project has not mentioned the risks that may be encountered when conducting. For example, a user wants to print a copyrighted 3D image but the owner has not signed a contract with METAIN, or it is difficult to contact the owner. So it will take a lot of time to process 1 order. In addition, there is no concern about the legal issue when authorized printers may disclose or leak copyrighted images, there should be a strict management mechanism for this.
The project's product is 3D printing done quickly by purchasing NFT and then choosing to print through a registered space printer, the users here are the customers who have the demand for 3D printing at will. I think the project's product has great potential to reach the community because 3D printing technology is becoming more and more popular.
The proposed project has a total budget of 175000 USD, which is a huge budget for Dapps projects. However, the explanation of expenditure items is still very sketchy, it needs to re-account the budget in more detailed items to ensure transparency and audit, the positive point is that the project has issued Tokens.

They yearn for stability, quality, consistency most of all, the power of consensus will give them the opportunity to participate in the Cardano ecosystem. Enthusiasm to leave no one behind, they sent over 150 people from cardano community members to Free $1,800 worth of Consensus when countless people were unable to participate in person to receive virtual tokens free $108.

- Fulfill four quarterly orders of 250 high quality super soft 100% cotton shirts with the Cardano Community logo & QR code designed by the extremely talented Snapbrillia design team. Upgrade Linktree to access Premium Analytics. I also somewhat sympathize with the budget in the proposal, the depreciating currency makes all operating costs limited, everything is expensive. With the experience of organizing hundreds of shows and exhibitions, they have also prepared the team that can negotiate all travel, accommodation, and accommodation costs. I found that the monthly conference budget analysis is very detailed, but is the spending too high, while he also said that he has a senior team they can negotiate on. expenditures. Other budgetary allocations such as: Community-requested group ticket sponsorship, additional exhibitions and sponsorship - $174,000.00. Verified cNFT minting fee - $600.00.

It's also understandable to create free exhibitions to attract users because it is not possible to support travel and food for everyone. I believe it is easy for you to understand this problem and proceed with it. . The project theme also clearly states the goal, opens the connection to cooperate to develop together and create a high value in work. Collaborators on this project include Timothy Vang who is French and holds a key role in the project and currently he is the distribution project manager with the Red Cross, Lockheed Martin, Boeig and the University of California.

Hopefully the proposed topic promotes the spread of information, advertising makes it easier to distribute and access content. The risk as well as the proposed topic is expected to be low initially due to their poor outreach. I agree with the view that sharing content on their channels will help credibility, help users understand who they are, and what they can do for the ecosystem. All risks in the proposal are explained very clearly and with solutions, showing us that the way of working experience is expressed through the way of speaking and spreading information to the community.

Along with a budget of $ 25000 divided into content development and support within 6 months is very reasonable and clearly optimized for the most budget.

- 3 articles curated, translated and enhanced for conversion articles (in English, Portuguese and Spanish) The coherence and clarity of their work helps me see that the Hopefully, their enthusiasm in the project is great, they hope their articles will be evaluated and commented on by Catalyst. They have also set up a Gitbook that makes it easy for the community to check out the project and are provided with a link in Catalyst's monthly reports. The project theme that describes the success of the project is to enter metrics related to the main EVM portal or contact to submit proposals to Catalyst, Number of articles translated per month, View number of articles translated optimized for EVM related searches.

Regarding the proponent's experience, she already has experience in the Catalyst community, however the operation of this proposal still lacks many elements of impact.

It is proposal that the interviews will be presented live on youtube or through the Zoom application and will be replayed on youtube? Normally, how many people attend the interview? Are these video interviews with only 2 people and no audience interaction? It is also a good thing to create live interview videos with other project ideas, as it will help viewers (who have needs and understand Catalyst) better understand the projects. However, just creating short interview videos is not enough to prove its impact on the community, because the community will have people who don't know about Catalyst, don't know the name of the project, how to they can search the project name on youtube.

I have looked through the youtube channel of the proposer, I don't see this as a potential channel, although there are a number of videos on the channel, but there is no SEO optimization, keyword optimization to develop a youtube channel.

Also, I underestimated that the proponent did not focus on a community audience before developing into another language community, meaning that on one video interview there will be up to 3 languages ​​​​translated, which makes does not help bring impact to many countries but instead is a waste of human resources. I rate 3 stars.",3,"There is only one host's social media profile information, which is Ms. Mie Tran. With the progress of the work in the plan, there are also many different jobs, but the number of members listed here is only about 2 people, I ask the proponent to provide more information about the remaining members.

This proposal asks for a budget for both fund 9 and fund 10 of $19020. The interviewer's working amount on a video is perfectly reasonable, as she understands blockchain industry terminology, however, the budget for a Video editor subscription is around $200/year, please provide a link or description specific to this budget. These are video interviews between Ms. Mie Tran and other project members, what does the budget for ""Content creator"" mean? I think our interviews will have common questions common to projects, and in-depth questions specific to each project, for which Ms. Mie Tran had to have texting and discussion sessions after reading the documentation, why pay for a content creator?

Landing page? Please provide additional links related to the proposal if any, currently I only see a youtube channel and a Twitter link (however, nothing has been posted yet). Social network management is 10 / each video, I have not seen this channel optimized, so what is this cost based on to list? And in the team of this proposal who is responsible for the task of managing social media channels? etc...

The budget of this proposal is too sketchy for their activities. Please provide additional links if the interview video is posted in more than one place, and keep up to date with the recommended metrics achieved in the past and the innovative improvements in this proposal.

She describes the success of the project as generating about 40 videos and ""with the hope of receiving at least 100 views on each video"", which is embarrassing for a youtube channel asking for funding. 100 Views for every video that doesn't speak will get 100 viewers, even the budget is close to $9,510 at fund 9 ($9,5100 at fund 10) for about 40 videos, that's about $230 for one video, but the result yield disproportionate. I underestimated the proponent's goal.

And her proposal has also raised funds at fund 7, but the current results do not speak to the impact.

After each fund is launched, the number of proponents and projects increases rapidly. As a result, voters do not have much time to stop to read each proposal in detail. As a result, voters may miss out on good, vote-worthy suggestions. The Cardano Catalyst TV project responds promptly to a need for the Cardano community, briefly summarizing a proposal with a 5- to 8-minute interview that is 3 to 5 minutes longer than Fund7's duration. The summary time for a recommendation is quite reasonable; it helps the voter quickly grasp the content and highlights of the project. When too many proposals are posted, Catalyst TV is the fastest way to reach viewers; videos with concise content and easy-to-understand presentations help the project get viewers and increase votes. Especially the content of the Videos is then translated into many languages; this is also a way to help many people know about your proposal and an effective advertising plan.

Currently, the proposal has been working very well; the proponent has completed the task of Fund7, which is to produce 38 videos. The proponent applies for funding to continue creating 40 more videos in the future. The project is intended to promote projects that have not yet been profitable; the proponent should have a detailed plan to generate income from the project to have funding for long-term operation and development. The group of proponents consists of 2 members, I think such a proposal group is a bit small, and the information of the interpreter member is incomplete. I noticed that the content of the videos is edited through another marketing agency. To proactively complete the videos quickly and reduce costs, the proponent should add more members to perform the steps of the project themselves. The proposal has a clear budget and is broken down into categories. In this proposal, I found that the funding budget estimate at fund7 was insufficient to cover the costs, so in fund9, the proponent applied for higher funding and asked for two, including fund nine and fund10. Proposal Cardano Catalyst TVs at greatest risk is time management of interviews, length of videos, and projects with high technical content. Proponents offered reasonable options for addressing the challenge of sending questions to voters for better preparation and limited-time access to key proponents. Besides, the project team exchanging the proposer's details to understand the interview's content is a good way to deal with risks.

The timetable is incredibly detailed, with an hourly program for the event and a clear idea of how the teams will be organized, registered, and so on. This is unusual in similar proposals. Another reason why the project is likely to be delivered in high quality is the budget breakdown, which clearly explains all of the costs with rationale behind them and provides a calculation breakdown for the most of of the costs. The budget, in my opinion, is well within the range for a similar event since it also includes prices for contest winners.

It also satisfies the challenge of Building Blockfrost, as the plugin developed on Blockfrost and will increase the usage & feature development on and with Blockfrost.

It has also include the user analysis, market research, and testing in multiple phases before submitting the stable version. The proposal has also provided the details of team member and their hourly pay rate at $150 for 4 people in a logical working hour and budget explanation.

The proposal provided the accessible under-development repository, yet they had not mentioned technical aspects requirements explicitly. This could also infer that the project doesn’t require any funding for technical properties (softwares, assets, hostings, etc) since it is not mentioned in the proposal. Could these points written in more details it should be more refined.
By the existing budget explanation, worktime plan, and currently developing status, the project is highly likely to be implemented successfully",5,"Giving 5 for the easy-to-audit final target the proposal has defined, which is by having their stable version usable and reach more user and developer, supported with their auditable defined roadmap of delivery, from feedback gathering, core development, and testing on the market users.

DM is a Dapp to expand business for independent artists, visual artists, gallery owners, etc. Artists can sell music for streaming and get 0.01% of streaming royalties. Artists can also use NFTS music to create smart contracts for their businesses. The impact of DM is not only to adopt and educate music activists in the Cardano ecosystem but also to serve as a one-stop resource hub for artists interested in getting involved in solutions Web3 on Cardano. I completely agree that this proposal effectively addresses the challenge.",5,"The proposal team is concerned with providing a short description of each member, and then we know their names and their roles. Despite that, it would be even better if they provided a social networking page for each member (e.g., Linkedin) because we can see each member's past experiences and connections. The proposal group described a detailed step-by-step roadmap. The live streaming, music streaming/physical merchandise components, and social aspects are completed. The next step is to implement the CNFT marketplace and blockchain-dependent features. However, the proposal team could improve feasibility by adding specific timelines for the work, for example designing all the necessary pages for the website within the first month after funding.
Regarding budget, I've found 110,000$ value fair for what the project purports. This value is divided into a few topics, which gives a good understanding of how to use it. However, I believe there could be more details. Example: Marketing and Project Management - $25,000. How to determine precisely how much money will be needed? Although, I believe the team gives us an overview of the budget and process, even if the details are lacking. 
",4,"The problem of bringing DM to market and reaching potential users is not simple. This process takes a lot of time, effort, and money. Besides, technical limitations are also a risk when there are many concurrent users. The proposal team has carefully analyzed these risks. Therefore, I also understand that success metrics during this period are difficult to quantify. We can only track progress and milestones through project management tools like JIRA, Slack, and Github. But in general, I think this topic is well covered.",4

The participant will be civically engaged in this event using gamification, social collaboration, and challenges. Through these interactive events, participants will directly take part by developing new ideas or projects in combination with Cardano Technology. It will give a huge impact on the Cardano ecosystem, especially ADA SOLAR which supports renewable energy. ADA SOLAR itself is an environmentally conscious project, born and funded through F7. The proposer explains the CLIMATHON´s benefits and goals in detail. In the future, the proposer will continue to promote environmental awareness by holding another similar event. ",5,"The proposer already has a team that is experienced in their field. Several of them are Summit 2021 Buenos Aires and Cardano Hackathon 2022 coordinators. The proposer gives a detailed budget plan, where part of the budget will be exchanged into SOLAR tokens as event-winning rewards. The proposer gives a detailed explanation of how to use the SOLAR tokens on the ADA SOLAR platform. Also, through the explanation, the individual will be able to invest in solar PV power by acquiring a certain amount of power (1 Watt = 1 Token SOLAR). The proposer has implemented the investment plan with a lot of benefits for investors. The most highlighted benefit is transparency in investment, through Cardano Blockchain technology, linked to clean energy generation. My suggestion is the proposer had an additional budget to execute the event-winning idea concept. For the timetable, the proposer lacks detail in explaining the activities of the event. I recommend the proposer make a complete rundown with details. Risk in projects tends to be in the number of participants, to measure the level of success. The proposer needs to make a pre-event marketing plan in detail since the proposer already mentioned them in the budget plan. From that plan, we could give any feedback regarding the marketing method to gain more participants.  ",4,"This event has a very short period duration, which is only 2 days. This can cause the main goal cannot be achieved optimally. It's a good idea for the proposer to add more days to the event so that participants have more time to think about ideas. The project has KPI achievements and milestones depending on the total participants so a detailed promotion plan will be needed to attract participants. If it's possible, I would suggest making a hybrid event where the offsite event is still running based on the time plan while other participants could also attend the event online. This idea could attract many community members, students, entrepreneurs, developers, and pro-green activists and enthusiasts who want to participate.",3

The proposal does not succinctly propose a solution for the problem in one place, but by playing boardgame and the name of boardgame is Cardania Educational Game. This game uses traditional elements such as dice, an hourglass, a board and puzzle cards, and can be played in teams or individually. The objective is to overcome puzzles and certain activities in order to simulate the operation of the blockchain. It Is good to learn basic concept of blockchain for people who non-technical that could understand function of blockchain and how the blockchain works. Cardania Educational Game have dynamic level difficulty, where participants draw cards from different decks in order to advance through the board in the fastest way possible. Reward will be earned according to progress and affect to the board mechanics. In order to bring this game popular to people who have non-technical background, the proposer intend to bring up event designed to teach basic blockchain concepts to 200 Colleges / Technical Institutes in Ecuador in the span of a year. In addition to this, the proposal asks for fund to run this project. based on the information given, this project contributes to Cardano blockchain ecosystem and also it addresses the challenge.",5,"Regarding the script, the team is defining the activities in two phase. First phase, they manufacture 200 board games and second phase, make the event to teach basic concept of blockchain as well as distribute 200 games to 200 schools and institute in the country. This second phase, it takes long time cause the team would travel to the state which school and institute located in the country. In relation to budget, the information is there and sufficient to understand how they spend the budget. The community could find type of cost to make the boardgame as well as cost for distribution of the board game with teaching basic concept of blockchain. In addition, there is information coordinator and instructor job/tasks with person in charge of the jobs. Given information provided, I think proposal will be implemented successfully.",4,"I find how the team concern with auditability. They draw up an auditability plan in which they would monitor the project’s growth, according to number of board games delivered to schools / technical institutes after the learning session, number of players participating in the game and number of wallets created. all we need to do is to have access to such information which perhaps they would generate and present to us weekly or monthly. I believe that monitoring this project is relatively simple, compared to other proposals. Thus, given information provided is sufficient to audit the progress and the success of the proposal",4
14966,"F9: Grow East Asia, Grow Cardano",Cardano Catalyst TV,https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBzmn,z_assessor_3368,1,0,415326,26602,"The idea of transforming simple articles into necessarily brief videos, combined with direct interaction with related-parties and linguistic diversity, is a noticeable improvement. 
In terms of impact, the concept takes a useful step for several reasons. Firstly, technological knowledge is assumed to be hard to acquire, so conveying information relating to technology through video feels much more effective. This form could be a solution to the problem of how to reduce the time needed for conveying technological experience while also creating attraction. Moreover, the video format offers greater space and allows proponents to express their personality and style in presentation than the traditional ways. Secondly, the direct asking-answering form not only properly meets the criteria for the challenge but also overcomes time-consuming problems and maximises efficiency in dealing with queries, especially when reports or proposals are in the worst scenario. In that case, problem-solving requires total coherence among parties that are related, and the direct asking-answering form can afford that. Thirdly, changing the format from reporting to video or expanding to a TV channel is a trend that many successful platforms have previously applied (YouTube, Tiktok) to provide more comprehensive content. If the idea is successful, it not only helps to optimise the Catalyst process, but it also serves as an efficient tool for future marketing. Finally, there will be more opportunities to conquer such a potential market like East Asia if a plan for diversifying languages is launched. As a result, it is simpler to interact with people in foreign countries because messages or information are more effectively communicated through images, videos, and accurate languages than by employing normal translators. Vietnam and Japan are wise moves in the plan. 
Generally, I will score this criteria 5 points.",5,"The use of video to communicate with connected parties on social networks has proven to be effective, so there is no doubt about the proposal's feasibility. On the one hand, I believe that direct question-and-answer videos on various social media platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, and others are more appropriate than traditional posts and comments. It means that the suggestion will reach a larger number of people. Furthermore, skilled and qualified professionals in the education and media sector are responsible for this project, therefore there is a chance that it would not only help develop the Cardano Ecosystem but also increase the ties of the East Asian community. On the other hand, I realise the proposal is still an incomplete picture. The operational costs calculated in the proposal show that the proposals are directly proportional to the number of workers. As a result, when the proposals expand, it will cost a greater number of workers. As far as I’m concerned, that is not consistent with the purposes of technology due to its unproductivity. In my perspective, directly adding the AMA form to the community through chatting in Telegram groups is a possible approach to boost efficiency. The solution's benefit is that it can keep the interaction going while saving time on video editing. Moreover, there is a huge income for us if proponents hire us to make their videos. When creating videos used to describe ideas becoming a service, we gain more advantages from saving time and manpower as well as increasing competitive advantages. Furthermore, if the videos are in high demand, the service could be expanded to include a question and answer section.
I will score 4 points for the feasibility. I hope that my suggestions could give you some ideas to improve.",4,"Today, it is normal practice to evaluate using indicators such as views, comments, feelings, popularity, and so on. These indications make a great point in that there are now many methods accessible to measure the effectiveness of videos, as well as support to improve transmission performance, so that we can proactively improve the quality by leveraging available models. However, the phenomena of faked channels and indicators that can be faked and spammed by tools may have an impact on the evaluation of the proposal' effectiveness. I believe that adding more indications will make the plan more thorough. To begin, we must assess the percentages of proposals that are approved and funded successfully while using the form, as well as the performance and time savings compared to proposals using the previous form. Secondly, when monitoring community development, it is suggested that tools be added to detect and assist individuals who do not have a fundamental understanding of Catalyst. This is also a great way to develop a new workforce for the Cardano community. Finally, focusing on enhancing and training new users who do not have a basic understanding of blockchain is more important than focusing on aiding individuals who already have a basic knowledge base. To support this goal, a series explaining terms and definitions will bring benefits for new users to catch up with Catalyst.

Ninh Tran makes a very good point in emphasizing community involvement and conferences as a quick way to spread Cardano's influence as a whole. It may seem that Ninh refers to Charles' quotes a lot in terms of responding to many of the important questions, but it shows me how both their missions and passions are aligned. It is a quick way to refer to the current milestones/goals of the Cardano ecosystem as a whole to contribute and serve back to the community.

We may be able to advertise and do several marketing campaigns, but the quick surefire way to spread the word is from fellow human to another. That is why this proposal has gained so much traction as it is an important indicator of how mainstream Cardano has become. Overall, this proposal effectively delivers the constructive need for this challenge. It is something that is highly valuable to show the masses and interest others to encourage going to conferences and spreading the word.",5,"I have attended several of Snapbrillia's town hall breakout room sessions hosted by Ninh and his co-workers such as Frank. They have shown tremendous potential in research and their ability to explain complex topics such as SSI and conference knowledge. Even putting aside my own observation, the background of each teammate comes from the web 3 platforms with more than 2 of them currently researching within the Cardano community. Their goals seem to perfectly align with mass supporting Cardano at conferences.

The plan suggested is very defined. They have laid out all the potential conferences that they plan to provide support for with crucial price arrangements. Their ability in the web3 space with Snapbrillia having their own dedicated web3 team makes it even more likely that they will deliver on the ability to mint cNFTs and properly represent Cardano at conferences. Based on the background references and their extensive reviews, it is highly likely that this proposal can be implemented not only successfully but also efficiently.",5,"The ability to audit this project's timeline is described in a simple but detailed manner. Their use of the IOG-developed DJED stablecoin will definitely allow almost anyone to track their reserves. While this may seem to appear as a vulnerability, it encourages transparency from Snapbrillia's team to the community. Taking into account for today's market where several exchanges are collapsing, I believe transparency to the public is an important and highly valuable asset to consider when trusting anyone with crypto assets. Their choice of using cNFTs to track community received tickets is also another tremendous approach to visibility because they all are highly auditable in terms of tracking the funds and involvement of the community. 

Overall, both in terms of auditability and feasibility, the success of the proposal seems imminent. The ability to communicate and appreciate the community is what is most valuable from this team and they have successfully shown to depict that same mindset across this proposal.

I believe that it would be much better if the team can find a way to gain the attention of experienced developers as well.

Everything according to his estimation is going to be ready after 60 hour of work and the author is requesting a total of $9000 for it.

As they will be asking academics and others to get deep into the technology and telecom infrastructure, the content of the findings will be interesting to read (which will be open source). They have highlighted and considered that the findings in the research and testing elements in their proposal may open up possible opportunities for future proposals. The roadmap is again sensible and clear which will make every monthly progress report easier to review. ",5

It also helps to increase the number of sponsored quality proposals on Catalyst. Large voters often do not have much time to consider proposals carefully and in detail. Having a short video outlining the project and the team and what makes it different will save these voters a lot of time. Proposal is also a trusted partner for non-English or Japanese-speaking proposal writers to easily introduce English and Japanese-speaking voters to the value their proposal will bring. However, during the interview, I think the author should develop different questions to explore all aspects of the proposal rather than a common set of questions for all proposals. However, I consider this proposal to fully meet the conditions required by the challenge, and a 5-star rating is completely appropriate. Hopefully the author will improve the video quality better and have more content, or can shorten the time and still keep the quality.

Looking at the author's information on linkedin with English language skills, I think the author will help a lot of teams and proposals in Vietnam overcome the language barrier and reach out to large voters. With what the author has done with the portfolio on linkedin and the content in the proposal that the author will do if sponsored. I have full confidence that what the author has put forth in the proposal can be done successfully.
Regarding the plan, I see that the author is writing not yet detailed. Additional costs or duties are required for communicating the videos to English and Japanese-speaking voters. Introduce new voters to the channel and showcase videos of proposed topics interviewed.",4,"Information provided by the author about the implementation process and the full cost of implementation. However, I have yet to see the author suggest the risks that would be encountered in the implementation of the proposal if the proposal was funded by Catalyst. For example, if the youtube channel is hacked and appropriated, what solution will the author have? Risky themes aim to scam by crafting a perfect proposition to attract voters and then take money and not execute. So how does the author have a solution to avoid cooperating with those topics with fraudulent intentions? Identifying those risks will help avoid costly repairs and delay the implementation process.
Finally, the author should have a video showing the number of successful funding proposals supported by the Cardano Catalyst TV channel after each Fund. As such, the community will see how the results of this proposal impact the development of Catalyst as well as the Cardano ecosystem. Finally, the author should think about building a business model that generates cash flow so that this model is sustainable and no longer depends on Catalyst.",5

This will help attract a large number of users who are using Wordpress using the Blockfrost API. The proposed solution will help users of websites using CardanoPress Plugin easily log in with their wallet address on Cardano instead of having to use accounts like Google, Facebook.
In the body of the proposal, the author should add some information, for example, who are the users of the plugin? What are their benefits?
This helps non-tech savvy voters understand the benefits of the product and the value it brings to the user.
The proposal should provide an overview of the implementation process.
Regarding the risk assessment, I think there is a risk that Wordpress regularly updates changes that could cause conflicts with an older version of the product. It was a suggestion I added to the author.
In the proposal, the author made it very clear that the proposed solution would help increase the number of subscribers on Blockfrost. This solves the claim made by the Challenge.",4,"The information on the proposed implementation plan is not detailed and needs to be added eg Which Member will perform the task?

Of course, this also depends on the quality of the work, so I can't comment much on this. It is just my own personal opinion.
The information on the team members is very clear and I have researched their profiles on Linkedin and found that they are a team with a lot of experience. Their skills are perfectly suited to completing this proposal successfully.
All information is very complete and detailed. There are only a few small additions that the author needs to add.",4,"About the audit. I suggest they should build a telegram channel and update the completed tasks so that the community can track the results of their work.
The author needs to add other metrics to evaluate the success of the proposal such as the number of plugin installs. The more rating points, the better.
This, in turn, helps me and the community see the effectiveness of the CardanoPress Plugin and see how users rate the quality of the Plugin.
Those are the information that I think the author should add and will make an impression on the voters.
In the end, I found that the author and team provided important information that led me to believe they were qualified to carry out this proposal successfully. I also look forward to using their products soon in the future.

This can be seen as an indirect method for proposers to introduce and explain the idea they presented in the proposal. Thus, the opportunities of getting more votes for their project to be financed are enhanced. If the proposal is completed effectively, it can absolutely attract more viewers and new users to our community. The interviews will be recorded and edited as well as translated to other languages like Vietnamese, Japanese, etc. It impressed me about the creation and innovation in the mindset. It is obvious to observe the impact of the proposal on most of Cardano’s community in plentiful sides such as linguistics, interaction, and marketing and bring Cardano closer to a lot more people outside of the community. The first benefit it brings to Cardano’s community is that people who are in community but non native English speakers can understand the content of each video that is published via plentiful social media platforms as mentioned above since the content is translated into multi-languages. Thereby, avoiding or minimizing the number of people that cannot reach the meaning due to the lack of English. By the way, this program will be a helpful tool for proposers to build a marketing strategy to spread the reputation as well as the project/proposals of Cardano’s community on other platforms. Therefore, Cardano’s community can enhance its profit as a beneficiary. Catalyst’s value will also be raised, and the brand name “Catalyst” is expected to attract more new proposals in most of the later funds as well as be easier for citizens all over the world to identify.",5,"The possibility of the proposal is appreciated by me. Firstly, since this proposal was successful in being the financed proposal at Fund7 in the past, there is a high commitment on the quality of the proposal. I expect this time participating the team can again achieve the same or even higher result in Fund9. The achieved result of this team was so amazing with such a huge creative stuff inside. Hence, I quite believe in the capacity of each member in the team. They already have diversity of experience and I do want to see more innovation this time. The proposer has attached the personal information of each member with such amazed experience in those proposals in a lot of previous Funds before. On the other hand,  the duration and timeline for each item in the worksheet is divided as more specific as possible, guaranteeing to finish before the deadline which is set up at the beginning. Lastly, a very detailed budget is a plus point for this proposal. There is a list of costs that may occur before, during, and after the process is conducted and it is presented chronologically. ",5,"Overall, in this part, I suggest that the worksheet should supplement some more details about the target KPIs like how many new local users will attend Cardano after watching those videos with the translated content, if possible, this would enhance the quality as well as the truthful level of the sheet. I mean the proposer should provide some spotlight for noticing which items are important in the timeline to measure the successful proportion in 100% total of the proposal. On the contrary, a recommendation here is that we need a particular unit as well as a number to estimate how large the size, or how popular as well as the completing progress. The requirement of asking for a specification might be difficult for the proposer to conduct but he/she can take advantage of the previous data and forecast the targeted numbers based on past success. This would be a great reference for the voters to make an evaluation of how effective the proposal is. This is a convenient method for us to follow the progress step-by-step, stage-by-stage. ",5

This clearly aligns with the goal of creating a thriving developer ecosystem around Blockfrost. Doing this via a WordPress plugin makes sense because of the vast number of users that are already on WordPress who could then easily incorporate the Cardano blockchain into projects that are already in development.

Additionally, WordPress is open-source, and CardanoPress has its source code hosted on GitHub as well which aligns with the stated goals of the campaign. It is worth noting that as of now, CardanoPress does rely on some closed-source and heavily centralized dependencies (such as Google ReCAPTCHA), but I believe this is a failing of internet development at large and not this project. This could be remedied in the future when suitably secure, open-source alternatives become available. 

The one real downside I see, is that the proposers make it clear in a comment that documentation is not part of the scope of this proposal, and that a separate proposal will be made for documentation purposes. I think that this somewhat undermines some of the impact this project could have. That said, I'm not deducting from the rating as every project needs a reasonable scope, and this one is rather large even without documentation, which can be massive.

Ease of use like this brings all the advantages of a blockchain system such as Cardano to the easily approachable masses. I am not a web developer, but with some WordPress experience, I was able to install the beta release on a WordPress site in an hour or so.
",5,"The existing beta release of the project provides a clear grasp of the technical side of this project, as well as proof of necessary skills. Additionally, considering that there is already a beta release for this project, and at a few sites with fairly mature implementation, I think the team has proven that this project is likely to be successful. 

I do think that there is a lot of work to be done in only 80hrs of work, but the team has laid out an easy-to-follow plan with comprehensive budget. They have identified two possible pain points in the area of approvals from WordPress (which they have addressed well) and approval from Blockfrost (for which the solution is somewhat nebulous). The team does not provide any road map for what happens if timing goes over or the budget is expended.

To see 5 stars in this category I would have liked to see the proposal have more explanation for why Blockfrost may stop the plugin from utilizing the API, and a less nebulous solution for how to get this approved. Additionally, I think it would've been prudent to discuss what happens if an unforeseeable circumstance pushes the time table back and the team runs out of money. The team's experience mitigates these concerns, but it would have prudent to address them.",4,"This project struggles to provide a clear view of what auditability will look like. The team states that "".... having the stable version, v1.0.0, will be the final goal for the proposal."" But there are no metrics given to say what qualifies as ""stable."" It would have been prudent to give something measurable such as ""inclusion of V1.0.0 in the WordPress plugin directory,"" but while this is mentioned as something that will happen, it's not stated as a goal. This means that, in theory, the team could be rejected from the directory, but still call the project ""stable"" and therefore a success.

Additionally, the team says ""Progressive milestones can be measured as we progress through the stages...."" but they fail to mention any official channels, frequency of updates, how often GitHub will be updated, etc. I think that it is easy to infer what this could look like, but it would have been easy to state where updates would be posted and how often this would happen.

The team has made it easy to infer what success looks like, and their experience lends confidence in the project, but from a standpoint of the proposal alone (which is what I’m assessing), metrics should have been more clearly stated.",3

Additionally, by using processes such as DID Verified Credentials and Verified cNFT on Snapbrillia’s Proof of Reputation System, it seems confident that bad actors can be limited via this screening process.

I truly believe this proposal will achieve most of its targets.",5,"I believe that the metrics and KPIs picked are good indicators for evaluating the success and progress of this proposal. The roadmap and date are very well written, which can be easily understood and kept tracked by supporters. We can even know what success looks like for the proposal because the reason why is the most important and supporters can always be aware of the time when the team diverts from the original path. Snapbrillia Demo and Town halls are brilliant ideals so that there is a feedback loop among the community and proposers. There is also a discord server where everyone can discuss and keep posted regarding the project. Overall, the auditability of this proposal is excellent, in my opinion.",5

This is a great and bold idea. This proposal is about difficulty setting. The proposal, as well as the overall tasks and milestones, are realistic. However, there is no mention of the likely community impact of the implementation. There are no measurable KPIs or impact measures in the proposal.

It is easy to understand the proposal's idea that Adiuvat is a Daap helping people find locations such as shops, cinemas, malls, salons, sports centers and other fun and recreational places which force people to have fun and go out. This makes a change in their behaviors, from a sedentary to an active and powerful lifestyle. I believe that Adiuvat is an interesting and useful product that can be built in the ecosystem, raising the reasons people have to interact with the Cardano blockchain that can help further drive more adoption, feedback, growth and even more innovations. The idea of the proposal is presented apparently. However, there are some additional considerations for the proposer to write in the proposal which helps make the proposal more convincing and reasonable with the challenge setting. The first one is existing products or integrations. The writer should say whether there is another dapp in the ecosystem that has a similar function with theirs or not. What are the core differences between the proposal being presented and those existing ones and why will that provide impact to the ecosystem? Or how the dapp of the team can integrate with the existing one and give the ecosystem a great combination. Those emphasize why Adiuvat needs to be built. About how the proposed solution will address the Challenge, the information is repeated with the situation and idea presented in the first part: “The typical user has become used to a sedentary lifestyle . His debt has grown and due to this as well as inflation and scarcity of resources he is stuck at home and unable to go anywhere.” Those are not enough to persuade the voter.  In this part, the proposers should show what results the project would give and how suitable and aligned they are with the KPI/Key metrics of the challenge. And after the project is completed, what can it contribute to the Cardano ecosystem? With that additional information, the proposal can be highly appreciated by the voters. In the risk part, the proposer mentioned the inflation and scarcity of resources producers, increasing prices and reducing the consumption. This seems to be the problem that happens to the people for the dapp Adiuvat to solve. However, it is better for the proposer to talk about the risks when the dapp is built, are there any bounders that prevented the projects to be successfully built. ",3,"I don't think the proposal is feasible enough. Proposal has no detailed plan, no timeline or key milestones for delivering the proposal, no detailed budget breakdown. It is better for the proposer to impress the apparent roadmap, milestones of the plan and the results that the project will give in each milestone. Also, the budget should be added in the proposal as well. In this part, details of the costs that the team needs to build the app. This can be the budget for Human Resources or the necessary assets for the project completion. In addition, it is vital for the writing to include details on the people who will work on the projects. The information on this proposal needs to focus on the people so that it can answer the question of who leads the whole proposal, who completes the work in each time of the process, and what is the strength of the workers. These are to prove that the talents have the ability to contribute to the success of the project. Whereas, the data that the proposal gives is the explanation about Maslow’s pyramid.",1,"I don't think the proposal’s auditability is explained transparently. The information is repeated so it is the same as the previous parts (impact and feasibility). It is better for the proposer to focus and explain more details about the project’s auditability. I think it is difficult for the community and voters to follow and assess the process of completing the project. After being funded, the team has to report to the community regularly. So it is important that the proposal shows how to evaluate based on the key metrics or transparent KPIs in each period of time like number of users, which part of work the team has completed, traffic, … This makes it clear about the results and the definition of the project’s success.

Videos are translated into many different languages, so the reach of users is also more diverse, in more countries.

Having been invested by Fund 8 is also an advantage so that the project can be continued to invest.

However, the Cardano Catalyst TV project also has some disadvantages. As follows:
1. Access to users is limited. For example, Youtube channel views are quite low.
2. Advertising strategy needs to be taken more seriously, and more cross-platform to reach a larger number of users.
3. The number of videos uploaded has not been scheduled to be released.",4,"Cardano Catalyst TV is quite transparent. The project has been deployed since Fund 8, there have been certain successes.

Directly interviewing Catalyst project owners makes it easier for users to understand the project, but the transparency of this is also a question mark.

Moreover, the projects interviewed are not necessarily good, sometimes it is exaggerated to affect the Cardano community.

The budget for the Cardano Catalyst TV project is also quite high, and please also Fund 10 (why it is necessary).

In short, the success of the Cardano Catalyst TV project is there, but it is necessary to have an objective view of each Catalyst project from the team that developed this project.",4

Thanks to this advantage, the artists may be interested in Cardano ecosystem, thus generating an adoption and education for artists. The proposers have done the similar project called jazzisdead, with 30 events and tours, and attendees will be introduced into Cardano and this project ecosystem. Therefore, this solution perfectly aligned with the challenge setting.

However, to increase the feasibility, the detail timeline (or time needed) for each task and process should be addressed in this proposal. Moreover, the budget should be more specific on how to calculate it, the more specific (and logical), the easier the project gets fund-raised. For example, the “Legal” part costs $35,000, and the proposers should clarify what included in that part. 
In terms of the human resources, the proposers should attach the work experiences, or a CV/LinkedIn profile to these members. For example, Devendra – the Python Developer, what is his background? How long he has been working with Python language? Answering these kinds of questions will increase the feasibility of the project.

Feedbacks from users about their satisfactions of the platforms e.g., ease to use, the percentage of income, etc. should also be considered.

They may argue that such a region may be promising for promoting a wider Cardano adoption since Latin America is home to many talented technology professionals and programmers. I am convinced by this resonsing. 
The description of the solution presents some factors that reinforce the need to come up with sustainable business practices and innovative steps to combat climate change through organizing a two-day Cardano Clamathon event.
“Cardano Community engagement” is a crucial part of three challenges designed for participants who will engage in the event. Through Cardano Blockchain technology, the participants may enjoy the benefit of transparency in investment throughout the Clamathon event which raises the public’s awareness of the utility of Cardano blockchain technologies. These elements of the project exemplifies how it perfectly fits the challenge.
In terms of the intention, it is clear that the event intends to attract Cardano community members, policy makers, entrepreneurs, students and other social groups and have a chance to earn rewards if they win. With the requested funds, the winning teams can opt to receive in USD or in SOLAR tokens and become part of the ADA Solar Farm Generation. This means that the event is also an attempt to draw more attention to ADA SOLAR, an environmentally conscious project, born and funded through Cardano Catalyst Fund 7, thereby adding value to the impact of the Cardano ecosystem.

I am just thinking whether it is free for everyone to join this event. This could have been stated I assume. It would also be good to indicate when they expect the event to occur this year.  
Besides a detailed plan, the timeline is well-constructed for 2 days with a description of key activities and some KPIs are well-defined.
While the expected number of teams who join is at least five teams, the number of mentors I see in the budget is four. I am just wondering what if the number of teams who join outnumber the expected one. Therefore, I would expect to see some rationales behind the number of mentors required that they are planning to hire.
Considering the marketing budget, it would be nice if the marketing plan with key activities and a timeline is provided, which I think would make feasibility assessment easier.
Regarding the budget breakdown, they provide a detailed description that covers different kinds of expenses and a total number of working hours. I can understand how organizers will spend the money, such as for hiring mentors, marketing, etc. Such information could have been specified in the plan.
With the former experience of coordinating Cardano Summit 2021 Buenos Aires event for 120 people, the team has proven themselves to be qualified profiles. This success can be verified via a YouTube video. They provide other relevant references for each member’s skills and background to be verified as well.

Maybe some reference links to platforms they are planning to use to broadcast the event should be provided as well. 
I understand how they define their success. Maybe some other relative metrics should be adapted to make it even easier to evaluate the impact the success has on the Cardano ecosystem.

Accordingly, the main purpose of this proposal is to develop CLIMATHON, an event that incentivizes people to come up with innovative ideas in protecting the environment as well as help them actualize those. As mentioned in this section, the ambitions of the project are raising people’s awareness of environmental problems, encouraging new creative climate solutions and taking them into practice. I believe that not only does this generate a positive impact towards nature but also it widens the Cardano ecosystem with a noble integration. Furthermore, if the event is well-developed, not only would the people within the Cardano community be attracted by it, but also many other people would pay interest into the event. This eventually incentivizes potential users and members towards the community. One good point that the writer makes is that the project targets a wide range of people within the Cardano ecosystem. The diversification of people is an advantage where there would be many people with enough intelligence and capability in order to generate actual impacts towards nature. Generally, the idea proposed in this section addresses the challenge submitted. The information included is also comprehensive and sufficient to be assessed wholefully.

At the end of this event, winners can opt to earn rewards in USD or in Solar token, which is used to develop a solar farm in the future. This is a creative point that incentivizes winners to support another nature-protecting project, which is also based on Cardano.

The intro video is a useful demo that shows the connection between Raspberry Pi and 3D-printer through your Raspberry Pi printer wallet (that contains the NFT within the Adosia Market or their partner marketplaces). The end result is that the users (who mint or drop their NFT collections) can have their 3D NFTs printed and delivered to them. The Adosia SpacePrinter is a fully cloud based printer deployed into Adosia Marketplace. Their MVP was funded in fund 8. This proposal is a complement to the Adosia Decentralized Marketplace and will allow users who do not own hardware nor technical expertise to join in the marketplace. The risk of this project is to find the best feature for the lite version that allows users to function and later upgrade the hardware.

From the conception of their 3D Design and Print NFT Spacecoins in fund 7, their initial MVP of the Marketplace and the Cardano Box System in fund 8 and now Adosia SpacePrinter Lite in fund 9, it is remarkable what the team has achieved so far.

Also it will add to project transparency to clarify more on the travel cost (airfare and bus ticket) e.g. how does the team come up with $4800 for this cost item? They might come for other funding rounds if good response from this project and expand to other LatAm countries. ",5,"The team views success of project as the delivery of 200 board games in 200 schools, 6000 participated in the game, and 800 wallets are created. In my view, the number is achievable within the timeframe set by the team. However, the team has not provide any links where the community can check project progress (official website, or social media e.g. twitter, telegram, discord) etc. The project already has clear understandable solution (educative board game) to bring knowledge to people with no background and address the challenge but there is no dedicated place that the community can track if the said targets have been reached. The auditability score of this proposal is 4 because the proposal still lacks an accessible public channel for delivering regular updates to the community for auditing progress. ",4

What is a bit unclear is the exact scope of this proposal. 
As far as the description goes, a service of decentralized 3D modelling and 3D printing of NFTs is established. However, the description does not go far enough to 
enable estimating the cost-benefit ratio of the proposal nor to enable one to see how scalable the proposal is.",4,"The proposers are well-known within the community and have in the past implemented proposals successfully. Let me say ahead that if it wasn't for that the feasibility 
of the proposal would be rated far lower; someone unknown to the community could not afford to post such a proposal and still get funded. The only thing that is 
positive about this feasibility section other than the implicit track record of the proposers is the fact that the proposers are transparent about the people involved 
and their qualifications and that some possible risks are discussed. Other than that there are a lot of deficiencies in the feasibility section: 
No detailed implementation plan/roadmap is presented, the budget is only posted as a lump sum and not further discussed or explained apart from the general 
concept that is explained very coarsely no further technical details are explained.",3,"The proposers are pretty transparent about their different proposals, which is a positive thing. Since the description of THIS proposal however is not that clear, 
no KPIs/metrics unless the ones related to the SDGs are provided. Also, no proper success criteria are shown. While a github and trello are mentioned they are not linked.
Since in the past, the Adosia team have delivered, there can however still be some confidence that they will provide some auditability.",3

The impact to the Cardano ecosystem of this project, if it succeeds, could be of some good level, as there is a target of 6k people that are to be educated about Cardano, and also it seems that this proposal does align with the Challenge settings, as there is a card game for the general public, that can onboard new members.
The problem is described well, the need of blockchain knowledge for the people with no technical background, but it seems that the solution aims to deliver educational materials and events to ""technical institutes"" as well. The proposer should explain better who is the target audience.

Based on the info provided for this section I rate it with 4 stars.",4,"The requested budget of $54220 is broken down into identifiable items, and they are easy to read and to understand for what the money are to be spent. The only drawback is the fact the project lasts for one year, and each Catalyst Fund event assures the payments por a period of 6 months, so it seems that this proposal should be split in 2 parts for a consistent feasibility (74 events left for months 7-12).

The rate for each instructor (4 in total) is $620/month (48h/month) which seems to be reasonable. The proposer should make a clear statement if there is an even split among the instructors for the 200 events, otherwise to reconsider the amount necessary to pay the work done by each instructor per participating events.

The timetable is very clear and the milestones and deliverables are presented. It is recommended to provide a curriculum of what topics will be discussed on the events and also what is the form of the educational materials (papers, videos, just chat etc.) if there are any than the card games.
The proposer has considered the challenges and risks relevant to this proposal and provides a way to mitigate them (1000 possible entities for meetings, and an efficient geographically distribution of instructors)

The team consists of 5 members (1 coordinator and 4 instructors), 3 already enrolled and 2 instructors to be hired. They do have some LinkedIn profiles presented but there is no info about teaching skills for the 2 instructors already in the team.

I rate this section with 4 stars",4,"There are KPIs/metrics defined to measure the success of this proposal. It is recommended to have a way to measure the user satisfaction for each event and per total, thus heaving a good view about what people are looking for learning.
We do have a problem that is clearly explained and the solution also well explained (but in need for a clear target audience).

It is mandatory for the proposer to set up a public channel for the community to follow the progress of this project (Twitter, YT etc.) and a periodically report about what was done and what are the conclusions.

I rate this section with 4 stars",4

The educational game Cardania is a board game that uses traditional elements such as dice, hourglass, board, and puzzle cards, and can be played in groups or individually. The goal is to pass puzzles and certain activities to simulate the workings of the Blockchain. Through this game, the proposal expands to bring events designed to teach blockchain basics to 200 Technical Colleges/Institutes in Ecuador over one year. The proposal solves the challenge completely, through this game that will bring new members into the world of Blockchain and Cardano, it helps non-technical people to understand the function of blockchain and how it works. blockchain.",5,"The feasibility of the proposal has some good points and some areas that need to be improved. Starting with the plan, the proposed team says that phase 1 will produce 200 games and provide a 3-week timeline. In week 1 the task is listed very clearly, but in weeks 2 & 3 the task mentioned is Create 200 board games. I think this should be described in detail because I don't know how this work will be done, or how many people will be involved in it. Phase 2 is an event that teaches blockchain basics and distributes 200 games at 200 schools and academies across the country. This phase will last for 12 months and is described in a concise and easy-to-understand manner.
Next, the total required budget of $54,220 is also divided into 3 parts. In general, the budget is allocated and explained in great detail, so I completely agree that this is a reasonable request.
Finally, the project implementation team, according to the proposed presentation, I understand that this team will consist of 5 members with which David Tacuri as the coordinator. The remaining 4 members act as guides, it seems that 2 of the 4 members have been identified, and the remaining 2 members are still looking for. This section needs to add more details because we only know their names, their professional roles, and also their associated profiles. It is not explained in detail what they have done so far in their professional life and how they interact with the Cardano ecosystem. So in this part of feasibility, I neither agree nor object because the information given is not complete.",3,"The proposal states that project progress and development are measured against the following criteria:
-Number of board games assigned to technical schools/institutes after the lesson.
-Number of players participating in the game.
-Number of wallets created
I agree that these metrics should be easily measured. But how can the community track the progress of the project? It would be great if the proposal provides us with a means of being able to track their project progress. All of this information will be needed to reach our community members, one way or another; for example through the Telegram group, and Twitter some direct and simple way for us to figure this out.
The success of the project is also very well defined which is great because it gives us insight into what needs to be achieved.",4
