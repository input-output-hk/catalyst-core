The current proposal system works well for ideas, start-ups and projects but is less suited to fund facilitators, connectors, documenters, mentors, researchers and other community service oriented activities. For this reason we need to experiment with alternative forms of challenges.\n\n \n\n\nThe Format:\n\nEach proposer signs up for the same commitment:\n\n6 months, minimum of 8 hours community service activities per week.\n\nEach proposer will be rewarded 2000$ per month (12000 total)\n\n \n\n\nReasoning:\n\nIf the budget per proposer is fixed this ensures that a total of 25 System Innovators will be funded in this challenge. This also removes any competition between proposers in price. Furthermore, by limiting the parameters, comparing between proposals and results is more straightforward. The commitment is not full-time to make this a gradual transition, and as most candidates have ongoing commitments in Catalyst.\n\n \n\n\nWho are System Innovators?\n\nA system innovator is someone who:\n\n\\* Seeks to coordinate and connect\n\\* works across boundaries\n\\* Looks for emergence\n\\* Embraces complexity\n\\* Thinks holistically\n\\* Innovates\n\n \n\n\nThe cohort should collaborate among each other and are encouraged to form loose groups. A common discord server will be set up by the challenge team and used as a way to stay connected. The work being done should be shared publicly and transparently.\n\n \n\n\nHow to propose:\n\n \n\n\nMust be a single proposer, no co-proposers.\n\nMust ask for 12.000$ and agree to the time commitment\u00a0\n\nMust commit to work open and transparently\n\n \n\n\nThe proposal should focus on\n\n\\* motivation\n\\* previous engagement in Catalyst\n\\* connections with other proposers\n\\* area of focus\n\\* examples of activities\n\n \n\n\nProposers are encouraged to reference other proposers to show intent to collaborate.\n\nProposers are expected to be engaged in Catalyst in other ways and roles.\n\n \n\n\nProposals that do not fit these requirements should get a rating of 1.\n\n", "importance": "If we only focus on creating solutions, sometimes together, no one is focussing on *how* *we get better at* solving problems together, always\n\n", "goal": "A network of Systems Innovators is formed who bring the community together in various constructive ways which lead to tangible outcomes\n\n", "metrics": "Increased sense of community, more collaboration and idea sharing outside of Ideascale.\n\nContinued engagement and collaboration among the cohort members\n\n"}', -- extra

More than half of our team have PhD in computer science, informatics and related fields.\n\nGiang and Loan both have master in Korea, Giang got his PhD in Sweden, Loan did her PhD in Switzerland, Son Hai got his master and did his PhD in France and currently working for kpmg in Germany. Hoa is a very talented engineer with more than 10 years of experience, who is playing the role of the senior architect for the product. Quang - our Business Manager, is professional with extensive experience in business intelligence, analytics and corporate functional operations.\n\nAnd last but not least we are lucky enough to have Cuong as our community manager.

    '{"solution": "Why fund this project?\n\n \n\n\nThe University of Oxford hosts some of the world''s brightest students. In order for Cardano to truly get a competitive edge over other blockchains is to have competent developers. That is why focusing on providing scholarships to students at top institutions such as Oxford is important. These are students who have not yet developed a niche and have no particular preference over a particular ecosystem. A scholarship could therefore be the nudge that makes the choice easy for them.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nAll other things equal (one might argue that Cardano is less accessible), a scholarship stipend providing a substantial economic incentive would surely tip over the critical group of computer science students thinking about becoming a blockchain developer to the Cardano ecosystem.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nThese scholarships should be regarded as investments into the long-term growth of Cardano. In order for Cardano to truly succeed, all that is needed is 100 superb solutions developed on Cardano. For this to happen, we need the best minds and these are students with that potential. This is a very small investment relative to the cost it would take to sway the very same students once they have entered the job market. At that stage, they would be earning six-figure salaries, and incentivising them to go for one company over another would require remuneration of a magnitude far exceeding the few hundred dollars of these stipends.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nWhy we will succeed\n\n \n\n\nOur key to success is to partner up with existing student societies in Oxford that will help us get a foot in the door. For example, the Blockchain Society, Mathematics Society, Economics Society, Computer Science Society and Africa Society. We then hope that the value proposition of blockchain on Cardano will be enough to make them want to learn more. We have already established relationships with all of the societies mentioned above, and are discussing details for community events. We have held our first event in collaboration with Oxford Blockchain Society: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lxPCgUNb9BC6E8BJlKYCqqaXBPeQA\\\\_95?usp=sharing\u00a0\n\nWe may also possibly reach out to relevant Societies at Imperial College and at Cambridge for this scholarship opportunity.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nWe have recognised that facing the different audiences from the different communities, we will have to create interesting and insightful content with specific targets in mind. After catching their initial interests in Cardano at our in person events, we need to continue to provide opportunities to keep them actively engaged in Cardano and learn more knowledge. Allowing everyone to participate to the best of their ability, whatever level they are starting from. These include running Discord channels that post learning materials, updates of Cardano community and chat about Cardano, article series on \u0091Medium\u0092 platform, guides on becoming Community Advisor and so on. We have a detailed plan: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AjRqAPDEIosDec4\\\\_nICMCzFIWVHAi3sQ/view?usp=sharing\u00a0\n\nWe have created the aforementioned Notion page: https://cardanox.notion.site/3aadf76a910e493894a5aa8dc4308ac6?v=dece0ab21e6d4b059eed7ba1db9b0722\u00a0\n\nWe have created fact sheets comparing different L1 blockchains: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x7xsdDIF6CT37-1jFV5hzoNjme6rEoz1/view?usp=sharing\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nWhen we then launch a competitive scholarship, people will want to prove their interest and invest some time into researching Cardano. This means that even if only 5 students will receive the scholarship, all of the students who applied will inevitably have invested a lot of time and effort into learning more about the ecosystem in order to make their application stronger (as we select on the basis of interest and competence).\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nAssuming each community event gets 30 attendees and we manage to get 1/3 of attendees to apply, we would get 30 people who now have a Cardano wallet (as we will ask for a public address) and be more invested in the ecosystem.\n\n"}', -- extra

We also will use our business network from the games & entertainment industry. Showing and promoting AdaQuest with different partners like IGN, Checkpointhub, GEE Magazin, and of course a lot of Influencers, Podcasters, YouTubers, and Cardano Partners like Playermint, Muesliswap, or Cardano SWARM!\\*\n\n \n\n\nKey Marketing Strategy: Organic, steady, and healthy growth without useless pseudo Influencer and social media spend!\n\n \n\n\nOur KPIs:\n\n \n\n\nEven if we are free and not at the \"mercy\" of a big publisher or investor, budget and time are always issues when it comes to creating games. As an independent developer, the biggest risk is that you will run out of money or dev power. Either someone will try to sell you a service he/she can\u00b4t deliver in time or someone create something you already paid for, but in the end, it is useless for your project :(\n\n \n\n\nTo mitigate this, we work only with people we already know and meet in RL or worked before with them. Sometimes we receive recommendations or test young talents before offering them a contract.\u00a0Our working and project experience will ensure to keep track of the budget and put enough into our reserve to be prepared for turbulences and struggles, which sometimes you can\u00b4t avoid.\n\n \n\n\nThat\u00b4s why we will track & measure this:\n\n \n\n\n\\* New user accounts after releasing the visual enhanced feature\n\\* Budget spend vs. Revenue after the feature release\n\\* Website Visits, Page Impressions & Views (\\*also YT, Twitter, etc.\\*)\n\\* NFT Sales after the release of this visual enhancement\n\n \n\n\nTarget Groups\n\n \n\n\nPrimarily:\n\n\\* Fantasy, RPG & pen & paper fans and nerds\n\\* Hand-drawn art lovers\n\\* Core PVP mobile gamers\n\n \n\n\nSecondary:\n\n\\* NFT & blockchain enthusiasts\n\\* Casual mobile gamers\n\n \n\n\nTertiary:\n\n\\* Mobile gamers\n\\* Curiosity-seekers\n"}', -- extra

    '{"solution": ">>>\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nI am the proposal writer and I have extensive experience doing business in Africa - specifically Ghana West Africa. This proposal is being submitted from an airport as I am in transit from Ghana for a research and discovery trip for WadaDex. The proposal is informed based on local real interactions and years of exposure to the political, social, and economic realities of the market. This is not a solution that is being parachuted in - it is designed with consideration from the ground up.\n\n \n\n\nWadaDex High-Level Process Flow:\n\nWadaDex as a platform is expressly designed to do the following in order of process flow:\n\n\\* allow the average person in an emerging economy the opportunity to use their most economically liquid and crucial tool, the mobile phone, to simply and easily be on-boarded to the world of crypto currency; this on-ramping is a critical step towards simplifying participation and accelerating adoption\n\\* once onboarded via fiat or mobile money, the user will have the ability to maintain their funds, transfer funds to 3rd parties, or transfer funds to our separate approach of establishing stability between our prospective WDX token and the more stable reserve international currencies\n\\* the focus of the underlying platform is capital accrual and token value reasonable growth or stability - the reason why this is crucial is that for many participants from emerging markets the core issue is inflationary destruction of capital. Through tokens and cryptocurrency, we can mitigate against this in a frictionless manner\n\\* once capital is parked in the platform, essentially providing a liquidity base, the next step has a two fold benefit of enabling individuals to participate in projects that may provide them a return in a frictionless manner; and by corollary to enable projects to list on the WadaDex in the quest of raising capital at a more manageable risk free rate\n\n \n\n\nThe financial underpinnings of the WadaDex will be built on traditional financial and risk management tooling in order to be able to easily and readily explain to third parties and regulators alike, the valuations, liquidity profiles, and risk metrics of the platform and the projects listed within.\n\n \n\n\nThe approach WadaDex will employ is to simplify participation in and accelerate adoption of cryptocurrency and decentralized ledger technologies; and facilitate capital access within a continent populated by developing and emerging economies with a wide range of currencies, risk profiles, interest rates, and primary GDP drivers. This is novel.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe mechanism Wada proposes is one Wada is uniquely positioned to build, deploy, and operate. The core of the Wada offering is the development and administration of a two-tier decentralized highly liquid platform that provides readily accessible fiat to cryptocurrency interchange and serves as both an on-ramp and parking place for capital within the platform. Accrued capital can then be deployed in a low friction, low transaction cost decentralized micro-capital market: WadaDex.\n\n \n\n\nThe WadaDex team is in the lucky position to have been able to put the principles of WadaDex into action with contracted Project Finance capital raising engagements taking place in African emerging economies. This brought even more clarity to the platform objectives, functionalities, and goals.\n\n \n\n\nAlignment with Challenge KPI\n\nThis project perfectly aligns with the Challenge KPIs - in particular the core principle of the challenge that \"for poor nations with no basic foundations, Nation Building Dapp solutions will be the building blocks enabling sustainable prosperity\". This proposal goes to the heart of:\n\n\\* halting the erosion of wealth;\n\\* enabling savings and passive accrual of wealth;\n\\* enabling participation in wealth creating ventures; and\n\\* reducing the cost of capital of projects through a mechanism that enables them to raise capital via the broader community, the Cardano community, and through the use of blockchain technology\n\n \n\n\nIn terms of the functional challenge KPI, alignment remains synchronized:\n\n\\* Diversity of Dapp''s use cases: as WadaDex is a platform, that is unique on the African continent, it is open to businesses and projects alike for the raising of capital and enables project owners and their community to define their own unique repayment, participation, or reward terms\n\\* Proposers commercial approach and negotiation strategy with different Governments: we have an integrated approach that includes discussions with government officials - in many instances at the highest level. We are mindful of the regulatory concerns but are insistent that WadaDex not be financed with traditional financing sources originating from within the targeted emerging economies.\n\\* Participation of Cardano''s Local Community Centers (Wada hubs): this project is closely tied to Wada, which is one of the most sought after Catalyst proposal partners and has a trusted reputation within the Catalyst community. WadaDex key executives are amongst the most active Wada participants.\n\\* Participation and/or partnerships with other international organizations: WadaDex already has associations in a private advisory capacity with prominent Development Finance Institutions in the US and Africa.\n\\* Number of countries covered, contracts signed: as this proposal is being written, SCI, a main WadaDex partner has no fewer than three pending Project Finance Agreements that are serving as actual use cases for the platform and its technological and strategic underpinnings.\n\\* Dapps impact on social/financial inclusion: the impact on financial inclusion will be catalysmic within the region if successful. At minimum the visibility WadaDex will provide to projects and the capacity for WadaDex to serve as a Catalyst Secondary market will boost the likelihood of success of many projects. This does not take into account the multiplier effect from having a platform that assists to quickly and inexpensively capitalize projects - capitalized projects create employment and opportunity\n\\* Dapps impact on economic development: the impact on economic development will be significant - the function of WadaDex is to effectively reduce the cost of capital and allow projects to define the nature of their project''s return in a flexible manner that is enforced not by leans and bank guarantees, but by the power of smart contract, Oracles, and community due diligence.\n\n \n\n\nProject Outcome Communication Strategy:\n\n\\* African Development Bank and other Development Finance Institutions will be key in communicating the existence and utility of the project\n\\* Wada''s comprehensive network of partners and projects within Africa\n\\* Local street preaching pastors in markets like Ghana\n\\* The newly developed BlockchaininBusiness.io Cross-Chain Connector Search Engine which is submitted as a Cross-Chain Collaboration challenge project here: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/401951/\n\\* The Catalyst Community will be key because one of the main reasons WadaDex was created was to create a secondary market for Catalyst projects that have received one funding round of capital but cannot rely on a capricious competition process for future funding rounds\n"}', -- extra

Our three focus areas allow us to connect and solve for any creative and/or technical need.

Influencer Marketing: We will work with top African influencers on twitter, tiktok, Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook as well as notable youth public figures and skit makers.\n\n \n\n\nSome key influencers in the African/Nigerian Blockchain Community include:\n\n \n\n\nCrypto Round Up Africa @CRAspaces on Twitter. Join in for a Twitter Spaces session to discuss Cardano Protocol.\n\n \n\n\nBTCryptoCoach @ThePaulOla on Twitter. 25.4k Twitter followers and an active Telegram Channel having 4.2k Subscribers.\n\n \n\n\nCrypto Coach @wisdomMatic on Twitter. 40.8k Twitter followers\n\n \n\n\nTola Joseph Fadugbagbe on Facebook.

Community Marketing: We will invest in building a community that will be hosted on a messaging platform like telegram, Slack or Whatsapp. This will help with engagement, networking and dissemination of information. This community will also give members a sense of belonging. We already have a telegram channel Telegram: Join Group Chat 4 and a twitter handle twitter.com/NIftyRow\n\n \n\n\nC. Event Marketing: We will leverage existing events and also create our own events - virtual and physical. This will help establish us as authorities in this space and open up for more opportunities. It is also a great way for us to do PR.\n\n \n\n\nD. Content Marketing: We will leverage on these channels to put out content - blog, twitter spaces, clubhouse sessions, Youtube, podcast. This will serve as a funnel to build our community.\n\n \n\n\nE. Email Marketing: We will leverage this to give updates to members of our community. These emails will be sent out weekly or can be sent as a monthly roundup.\n\n \n\n\nF. PR: To stay top of mind, drive awareness and relevance, we will invest in doing PR quarterly. This can be on radio, TV or popular digital news and tech blogs.\n\n \n\n\nG. Events: Finally, for the purpose of strengthening Cardano''s African ecosystem, it will be important to continue sponsor and participate in events such as conferences &\u00a0meetup\u00a0for the creative communities in Africa.\n\n \n\n\nH. Good Publicity: For the success of a Creatives DAO we believe it is crucial to spread the word on the benefits of Cardano -and blockchain at large to various key stakeholders in government and the general public who have misconception of blockchain as been related to money laundering and scams. A good outline of Cardano''s project catalyst with appropriate media campaign will go a long way to alleviate this misconceptions.\n\n \n\n\nFurthermore, the governments can be made more aware of the negative impact of counterfeiting on the creative communities including stagnant growth of the art industry and increased unemployment.

But in the Cardano Ecosystem we have a set of open source projects that have \\*no standards for basic cross-project integration\\*. For instance, there are no standards on how to \\*document, set-up, and contribute-to projects. Moreover\\*, there is no \\*common infrastructure\\* that the projects can use to \\*track issues\\*, and \\*publish\\* basic \\*public information\\* about the \\*projects funded by the community\\*.\n\n \n\n\nWe are of the advise that \\*we need a set of standards, processes, and infrastructures to be used by the Cardano open source projects\\*, such that (1) The teams of different O.S. projects\u00a0can easily \\*collaborate\\*; (2) New-joiners can easily \\*discover\\*, \\*understand\\*, \\*test\\*, and \\*contribute\\* to existing O.S. projects; (3) Cardano O.S. projects can access a pool of basic \\*infrastructures\\* and \\*tools\\* that are needed.\n\n \n\n\nMotivation\n\n \n\n\nAs mentioned by Charles Hoskinson [1] \"Cardano code is Open Source, but needs to be managed like a true open source project, like Linux and other O.S. projects [..]\".\u00a0\n\n \n\n\n[1]\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T88\\\\_XKzi8ms&t=492s\n\n \n\n\nIn order to proceed in this direction, we need to use\u00a0\\*Catalyst as a governance over a true, vendor-neutral open source and open-standards ecosystem\\*. To achieve that, we are missing processes (e.g. how the project teams should behave and participate in the ecosystem), and infrastructures (e.g. VCS, CMS, Wiki, Forum, etc.)\n\n \n\n\nGuiding questions:\n\n \n\n\n\\* How can we guide the growth of a vendor neutral ecosystem?\n\\* How can we build a common identity and increase awareness on Cardano projects?\n\\* How can we increase the discoverability and the commercial adoption of our projects?\n\\* How can we increase the degree of collaboration across different projects?\n\\* How can we lower the barriers and increase open participation to our ecosystem?\n\\* How can we provide equal opportunities to all projects no matter the size?\n\n \n\n\nPossible directions:\n\n \n\n\n\\* Incentivize collaboration across projects to solve complex problems\n\\* Introduce common standards and processes and incentivize their adoption across projects\n\\* Provide cross-project infrastructures and tools needed to co-ordinate\n\\* Ensure the existence of a cohesive knowledge base\n\\* Support a network of professional technology ambassadors\n\n \n\n\nNote\n\n \n\n\nThis challenge builds on top of the existing \\*F8 Open Standards & Interoperability\\* and is loosely related to\u00a0\\*F9 OSDE Open Source Dev Ecosystem\\* (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/401296).\n\n \n\n\n\\*Shortly said\\*: This challenge (OSI) is about Openness, standardization, and interoperability across open source projects funded by the community, while the \"open source\" (\\*OSDE\\*) one is about increasing the number/quality of projects.\n\n \n\n\nReferences\n\n \n\n\n[OPSTD]\u00a0Almeida, Fernando & Jos\u00e9, Oliveira & Jos\u00e9, Cruz.

On the long term, all of the community-funded projects should be open and transparent by following common standards.\n* There should be observable improvements: easier to discover projects and find project resources, more intuitive to access project knowledge base (documentation, how-to, etc.), and simple to find and contact project members.\n* It should be possible to have project synergies by allowing simple inter-project communication, knowledge sharing, and re-use of existing components/services.\n* We should observe an increase in open-source contributions to different projects: both from new joiners and from other people already in the Cardano community\n* We should observe an increase in reputability of the Cardano Open Source projects.

When the auction ends and a buyer has won the auction, the NFT will be locked within the application to ensure that the seller does not have the ability to pull the NFT after the auction has ended. Additionally the buyer will not be able to send payment for an NFT if the seller has removed it from the escrow wallet. For the user\u0092s privacy, no data would be collected or stored remotely.

PAB Helper \u0096 Under development.\u00a0This is the most likely transition pattern for dApps toward Light PAB.\u00a0Nami demo.\n3. Light PAB \u0096 Not yet supported, but on roadmap.\u00a0This will likely be the dominant dApp pattern once Light PAB is available.\n4. Hobby and Education\n\n \n\n\nPlease see attached diagrams for variations of those four use cases as adapted for a container / shared infrastructure implementation pattern we propose.\n\n \n\n\nAssumptions:\n\n\\* Our containers will be pre-loaded with Haskell, Cabal, plutus-apps, and nix-shell appropriate for version of Node and PAB supplied in container.\n\\* nix-build / cabal build (as appropriate) will already have been executed for plutus-apps and nix-shell will execute PAB and Wallet without additional building required.\n\\* Container will be accessed via SSH / SFTP, no GUI.\n\\* http(s) interfaces for all services that users need exposed MAY be exposed publicly (via the UI), including wallet API and Swagger UI that are helpful for troubleshooting and testing.\n\\* Node and Chain Index that run as services on the host will log to journal.\u00a0As a result, tailing journalctl (-f) in a container console would yield sync status and transaction output normally found on stdout.\u00a0We admit that isolating and directing specific user events to a container might be a trick.\u00a0It\u0092s an open item for problem solving during design and implementation. We may instead isolate and direct these messages to the UI.\n"}', -- extra

    '{"solution": "Aligned with the goals of Cardano & Atala PRISM\n\nIn the \\*initial step\\*, the project adds immediate value within the \\*Cardano\\* ecosystem:\n\n \n\n\n\\* Existing and newly founded projects can get trust delegated to their project on the basis of statements made by trustworthy and known entities. The willingness to try out new scripts or projects increases significantly if it is evident that a project is verifiably supported.\n\\* The use of DIDs is a prerequisite of these cryptographically signed statements. Thus, the proposal promotes not only the direct adoption of DIDs and the use of \\*Atala PRISM\\* but also the entire DID ecosystem as a whole: such as Wallets, DIDComm mediators, authentication solutions and more.\n\\* Through the publicly visible use of the verified credentials on websites, the project also creates a multiplier that generates a much stronger growth effect than verified credentials that are private in nature and have no external visibility (e.g. credentials in a user''s wallet that rarely need to be presented).\n\n \n\n\nIn the \\*second step\\*, the project helps to build trust beyond \\*Cardano\\*:\n\n \n\n\n\\* In addition to endorsements, acquired credentials from other areas of life can also be presented publicly, e.g. university degrees or certificates from courses. At first on a private website, later perhaps also on \\*LinkedIn\\* or \\*Twitter\\* profiles.\n\\* Cryptographically verifiable endorsements can also be used in online-stores to promote sales. The cryptographically verifiable way of testifying is superior to the often expensive and very questionable trust badges of existing providers in the \\*Web 2.0\\* world.\n\\* Other parties, like politicians, well-known personalities, magazine and journalists or product testers can use the system to support trustworthy projects o. products.\u00a0This includes not only companies, but also social institutions and NGOs, which often depend on trusted recommendations.\n\n \n\n\nTrust is not only the technological basis of blockchains and SSI, but also of \\*Cardano\\* as an ecosystem and unique selling point within the crypto space. The project contributes to strengthening this trust even further.\n\n\u00a0\n\nGrowth, Communication and Marketing\n\nBased on the very nature of the project, marketing will benefit significantly from network effects that can lead to self-propelling marketing effort once a critical mass is reached: If projects within the community receive endorsements from \\*IOHK/IOG\\*, \\*EMURGO\\*, \\*Catalyst Circle Members\\*, \\*Charles Hoskinson\\*, or other well-known individuals or influencers, this will support their growth and as a result drive other projects to seek endorsements as well. A snowball effect can start within the \\*Cardano\\* ecosystem and continue beyond: cryptographically verifiable endorsements can be a hallmark for any project.\n\nHowever, marketing is not a no-brainer: for the first time after the completion of the MVP, the project has to seek endorsements itself: on the one hand to demonstrate its functionality, on the other hand to make the project known. Networks and partnerships are essential, especially in the beginning, to reach critical mass. Besides communication of the project, and the creation of educational material, technical support is also essential to make the integration for onboarding projects/websites easy. The technical hurdle should be as low as possible. The unique advantage within the crypto space and \\*Cardano\\* in particular is the high proportion of people with technical expertise, which certainly increases the probability of successful integration on one''s own website compared to traditional business areas.\n\n"}', -- extra

Many great minds are at work organizing communities and struggling with the tools available. Littlefish is a solution to decentralized collaboration that supports both the end users and the builders of these communities.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nOur guiding questions:\n\n \n\n\n1 - What are the key applications that underpin the application ecosystem on other platforms?\n\n \n\n\nTools enabling decentralized cooperation exist on other chains and are growing in popularity while Cardano lags behind. Tools like Coordinape and SourceCred provide a method of valuing effort and funding decentralized work. Littlefish Platform funding colonies through Actions is comparable yet a complementary method of funding work.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\n2 - What needs do users of Cardano have that could be solved by new applications?\n\n \n\n\nA critical problem many Cardano users are learning about is coordinating collaborative efforts in a decentralized world. Existing tools lack the focus and the incentives to align individual efforts towards collective goals. Decentralized communities like Catalyst, Cardano4Climate and others need user friendly tools that are purpose built to coordinate between members.\n\n \n\n\n3 - What applications deliver the highest amount of value with the least amount of technical sophistication?\n\n \n\n\nMost blockchain DApps are not user friendly. They demand technical knowledge. Wallets, signatures, irredeemable funds, terrible UI/UX \u0085 Things are scary for the layperson. The applications that will provide the most value will be those that make it as user friendly as possible. It will be those that abstract away the technical complexities and hide it behind pretty UI/UX. This is what we believe in our design. We will always aim to improve usability and bring value to casual users beyond the blockchain bubble by making things accessible. We believe this will not only provide the most value to end users but bring in more users. As the challenge states: Quality Dapps and integrations will increase utility & adoption of Cardano.\u00a0\n\n"}', -- extra

Some of the semi-related categories were developer ecosystem, open-source ecosystem, and Business creation.\u00a0While our end objective is in partial alignment with each of these, the main focus and output of our current proposal is only the solution of a particular phase of development. That is, obtaining a foundational suite of algorithms and infrastructure to begin to address further developments at later funding events (either through project catalyst, SingularityNet\u0092s DeepFunding, or third party funding). So, as this proposal is foundational specifically to physics algorithms and implementation with Nunet, we find it difficult to make a compelling argument in other challenge settings. Although, we do have smaller proposals to begin outreach to both industry and academic collaborations to begin this transition in parallel if possible.\u00a0\n\n"}', -- extra

An additional problem is how to mobilize effective actions to manage the identified risks.\n\nWhile there are some early warning systems, these tend to be very centralized, state-focused and highly bureaucratic. These factors hinder their effectiveness.\n\nBlockchain technology can contribute to solve these problems by creating a decentralized system for identifying risks and mobilizing rapid responses. This would favor a truly collaborative approach among different stakeholders to work together in implementing quick and effective preventive strategies to uphold human security.\n\nSimilar successful experiences:\n\nUshahidi: An open-source software with the intent of strengthening communities, empowering users to rapidly and purposefully gather, analyze, respond and act on data and information.\n\nECOWARN: an observation and monitoring system for conflict prevention and decision-making developed by the Economic Community for West Africa , ECOWAS\n\nEarly Warning System of Colombia\u0092s Ombudsman office, SAT: SAT identifies and assesses situations of risk for civilians derived from the armed conflict.

    '{"solution": "The main challenge behind faster and wider adoption of blockchain technology is the lack of the technical knowledge. Because blockchain technology (in general) is still in its early stages, end users are still encountering certain difficulties in terms of technical comprehension of the technology and its idea. Platforms for educating and retaining expertise in the blockchain sector will become necessary as the adoption and use cases of blockchain technology grow in the next few years. Blockchain technology employs cryptographic methods that are distributed across a huge network of autonomous computers. Understanding of the relevant processes is essential in order to exploit blockchain technology. Any business that wants to leverage blockchain technology and lacks the skill to do so in house can benefit from a BaaS platform. Even larger businesses should consider what their expenditure on blockchain management is and if it would be more effective to use a BaaS provider.\u00a0With this proposal, we would create the first Cardano BaaS web application offering of services of this magnitude. To the best of our knowledge there are no platforms offering easy prototyping of Cardano through blockchain as a service offering.\n\n \n\n\nVizLore Labs is a non-profit R&D organization founded with the aim of researching, developing and promoting state-of-the-art technologies. In the last few years, blockchain has been our passion and our work is fully focused on the development and promotion of services based on distributed ledger technology. For wider adoption of the blockchain technology, we will offer ADA-BaaS service completely free of charge for Cardano blockchain enthusiasts and developers, except for hosting charges if the created blockchain networks are deployed to our cloud resources using the click-to-deploy feature.\n\n \n\n\nCustomer acquisition will include three overlapping activities: (1) social media campaigns, (2) email campaigns and (3) targeted Cardano partners outreach campaigns. The primary channel for customer acquisition will be through Cardano\u0092s official communication channels and community social groups on: Cardano Forum, Facebook account, Cardano Official and Shelley workgroup, on telegram and Cardano Catalyst Community Site.\n\n \n\n\nThe ADA-BaaS project is not expected to end with development tasks under this project. Instead, the goal of the platform is to nurture all future ADA blockchain features and services that are created by the community. It will allow for plug-and-play components and additional services, making it easy to integrate new ADA features that come either from the core development team or through funded community projects. For example, users can choose to use or enable an additional service (coming from the ADA community), such as a trust framework feature over their network, web-based transaction editing (service that lets users craft token mint transactions in a guided UX), personal identity management and account authentication services (HD wallet-based identity and authentication operations) and so on.\n\n"}', -- extra

Progress, freedom, liberty, and change can only come at the free expression of ideas which Cardano has done little to promote. This is because Cardano has not changed the way in which \"Logic\".\n\n \n\n\nFurthermore, slanderous lies about blockchain technology plague the media and threaten the Cardano ecosystem. Projects that guarantee freedom of speech but not freedom from consequence in the case of slander, libel, and other fallacies, will ensure Cardano has a future and developing nations have a future too. Crypto has already experienced threats of censorship, crackdowns, and in many countries outright bans. The FatF has already made Crypto recommendations, and blockchain technology may be stifled before it even has the ability to grow if we do not create favorable media coverage.\n\n \n\n\nThe Ethereum foundation, for example, realizes this and is merging with Reddit to create a friendlier media crypto relation and Ethereum based social media tools. Even to remain competitive we must begin to investigate building a crypto news/social/and video site.\n\n \n\n\nThe Crypto world has metaphorically put the cart before the horse or the chain before the block. This is in no way a statement of blame but simply a statement from a differing perspective. The reason for this is because we have cut corners despite trying to move as slowly as possible. In the hurry to create all these great projects to better the world, we have not thought about the first tool used to create these projects. That tool being logic.\n\n \n\n\nLogic has evolved to the point it is; to many in this block-chain business simply code or ways that machines communicate with each other. However, this is only a version of what logic could be much like the form of logic I will present to you today.\n\n"}', -- extra

    '{"solution": "The portion of our overall project in scope for this proposal is a Minimum Viable Product that could be built on Cardano.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nWhat does success look like? In brief, success for CarbonNo means becoming one of the primary dominant marketplaces for voluntary carbon credits and establishing a reputation for having the highest quality credits. Success for CarbonNo specifically would be reflected in these top-line metrics:\n\n \n\n\n\\* High market price per tonne relative to other marketplaces\n\\* Ease of use reflected in high growth rates of B2B and B2C users\n\\* High volume of trade relative to other marketplaces\n\\* Widespread trust in CarbonNo reflected in market price of CarbonNo Coin\n\n \n\n\nCarbonNo\u0092s success would also most likely drive Catalyst program KPIs:\n\n\\* # of Cardano dApps supporting business solutions:\n\\* CarbonNo itself is such an app. In addition, the large amount of carbon-related data available transparently on-chain would open up new possibilities for other dapps to be built that feed on that data.\n\\* # of existing companies proposing Cardano-based solutions\n\\* Success of the marketplace would bring positive sentiment to the Cardano community and motivate more developers to use it for their solutions\n\\* # of partnerships / joint ventures created between companies\n\\* Every carbon-credit developer/generator participating in the marketplace represents one more company forming a partnership with the Cardano community\n\\* $ additional funding from other sources for the funded proposals\n\\* Catalyst is only a small portion of the funding we are seeking from multiple sources. In addition to this, the incentive-creating system of the CarbonNo ecosystem is similar to Catalyst and in theory could be used to fund ecosystem development in addition to carbon projects.\n\\* $ projected cost savings\n\\* This entire project is based on cost-saving projects based on energy efficiency, which have established principles of validation via the ICP as described above\n\\* $ projected revenue increase\n\\* Current voluntary carbon markets are roughly $1Bn/year, growing as much as 58% year-over-year. This leads to our own revenue estimates of $10-50M/year depending on whether we capture 10%-50% of that market. Our revenue would grow at the same rate as overall market volume, plus growth in our market share, plus a superlinear factor based on speculation and staking value-generation driven by positive sentiment. When voluntary markets eventually merge with compliance markets, as they are likely to do, we would then be able to capture some portion of what is likely by then to be a $500Bn/year market.\n\\* % growth in mainnet / testnet activity due to business solutions\n\\* Each transaction on the marketplace, and each transaction on the CNC-USD exchange, represents additional mainnet activity. So CarbonNo\u0092s success would drive growth in mainnet activity roughly in proportion to our own growth. In addition, there will again be a superlinear factor due to ongoing increases in the level of detail included in CNFT metadata (such as finer spatial and temporal resolution).\n"}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "Many countries around the world suffer deeply from educational gaps when compared to first world countries; this in turn affects their technology advancements, economic development, and innovation efforts. And although one could say that the responsibility falls solely on the hands of governmental groups, at times it\u0092s necessary for people to step up and together become the catalysts and drivers of solutions.\n\n \n\n\n\u0093Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it''s the only thing that ever has.\u0094 - Margaret Mead\n\n \n\n\nThis challenge is set out to find new educational methodologies, solutions, shifting current educational paradigms, providing more international inclusiveness and more importantly, to show how Cardano\u0092s technology can really truly make an impact at the root level of many developing nations: Education.\n\n \n\n\n? To CAs and Voters:\n\n \n\n\n1. Check that a proposal does not exceed more than 15% of the total Challenge Budget\n2. Give bonus/cookie points to proposers showing collaborative traits with other proposers\n3. Ensure that proposals account for infrastructure concerns, and local needs\n\n \n\n\n? To Proposers:\n\n \n\n\n\\* Translations aside. In developing regions, how can we best educate people about Cardano\u0092s technology?\n\\* How can Cardano\u0092s technology and/or the tooling being built around it be used to create innovative educational initiatives in developing regions?\n\\* The field of blockchain for education opened the door for new areas of research; how can we best explore the field and come up with new useful data for the ecosystems?\n\\* How can we accelerate the onboarding of traditional developers into Cardano\u0092s Blockchain technology?\n\\* How can we get academia (Universities, Colleges, and Polytechnics) to assist with the education, and adoption of the technology?\n\\* What are some lobbying strategies people could use to introduce Cardano to the broad international community?\n\\* How can we bring educational information to people who normally do not have access to the content?\n\n \n\n\n? DO\n\n \n\n\nThink of solutions that will generate excitement amongst the people you aim to onboard. Examples could be hackathons, interactive/networking seminars, technical formation centers aimed towards Haskell/Plutus skills, Cardano 101 sessions, media content, and more!\n\n\u00a0\n\nSeek collaborations with other Catalyst-grown projects that are currently building in the educational space.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBuild educational applications, platforms, and/or marketing plans to help boost education using the technology.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n? DON\u0092T\n\n \n\n\nFocus solely on translating material. Although it\u0092s still needed and proposals are welcomed; know that for education to have a better measurable impact, translations should be paired with good methodologies for digesting and teaching the content to new individuals.\n\n\u00a0\n\nExpect results in extremely short time frames. Know that educational processes can take some time, and that is okay. I know we all have a thirst to see technology spread like wildfire, but people learn at different paces and the technology is still a bit young, so implementing paced methodologies is probably a good idea.\n\n", "importance": "Unequal access to education is a problem affecting many regions. This in turn slows down technology adoption and innovation.\n\n", "goal": "Successful application of Cardano to education initiatives, and the integration of people into the Cardano/Catalyst/Plutus ecosystems.\n\n", "metrics": "* Measurable growth of Cardano education-oriented initiatives targeting education gaps, international influence, adoption, or innovation\n* Measurable growth of spoken language diversity in Cardano/Haskell/Plutus Developers\n* Increased international diversity of people onboarded into the ecosystem\n* Increased participation from developing regions in Cardano/Catalyst ecosystems\n"}', -- extra

Alonia aims to hit at least 50000 organic followers in the next two months. Without vested interest in the game, any game will not thrive. Our goal is to build a healthy and supportive community that believes in our vision of Alonia.\n\nPhase 1 of Alonia:\n\n\\* Alonia Mini game: Provide NFT utility to NFT holders of Alonia where they can use their NFT characters in our Mini game.\n\\* Alonia Marketplace: Provide a sophisticated marketplace for users to trade their Alonia NFT.\n\\* Alon Staking Pool: Incentives our Alon holders. Rewards will be provided for staking Alons.\n\\* Phase 2 of Alonia:\n\\* Alonia''s main game will be a fun and competitive PVP Tower defense game. Tower defense is a genre that has a legacy status in the gaming community. Ever since the inception of Warcraft 3 days, various versions of tower defense games like HellTD, legion td, green td have been created using the Warcraft engine editor. We provide a game mode with characters that the gaming community can relate to and enjoy.\n\n Alonia Main PVP game\n\n\\* A Creature based PVP Tower Defense Game.\n\\* Inspired by Warcraft 3 characters and lore.\n\\* It will be launched on Cardano.\n\\* Maze Structure TD style(not auto battler). Towers Shooting Units in a Maze\n\\* Battle Royale Style: Each player gets matched with a random player. Have the ability to send Creatures to opponent waves.\n\\* Objective: Defend an Energy Orb. When the Orb dies. The player is eliminated.\n\\* Build your team of Guardians(towers), Legions(Mercenaries).\n\\* 5 classes: Beast, Aquatic, Nature, Titan, Dragons.\n\\* NFT: Alonians, Guardians, Legions\n\n\u00a0\n\nReward System\n\nWe will be implementing a play-to-earn model that is unlike any NFT game out there; where the utility of their reward token is very limited and constraint to merely the production of more NFT. Our P2E model is sustainable due to the fact that we have an abundance of utility for our reward token $SPIZE:\n\n\\* Winner of each round(atleast top 3) will be rewarded with our reward token $SPIZE.\n\\* $SPIZE utility:\n\\* Cloning NFT\n\\* NFT burn\n\\* Purchasing Alon Capsules(NFT)\n\\* Participating in the Create-to-Earn Game mode\n\\* $SPIZE staking\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n Create-to-Earn Co-op Game mode\n\nThis mode will be a Co-op mode where players can team up together to clear waves of monsters in a Tower defense format. Strategize and form a team to defend your Energy ORB.\n\nIn the Alonia Metaverse, we will be distributing scarce Lands as NFT. We aim to allow players to have ownership over the Alonia Universe. They will be able to contribute to the economy by providing another avenue of income for the player base of Alonia. This mode will further contribute to the utility of $SPIZE where players will be required to use $SPIZE to participate in this game mode.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\* The Create-to-Earn game mode allows players to leverage their ownership of Alonia Lands by allowing public players to play on their Lands for a fee.\n\\* In Alonia, we reward players for being creative in customizing the Land they own in the form of Dormant Lands. A player can play these Lands for an amount of $SPIZE as payment which goes to the Land owners.\n\\* Infested Land Mechanics:\n\\* Land Owners can host their Infested Lands for public players to join. Players will be playing a Survival Co-op mode on these Lands .\n\\* Each Land is unique in regards to what type of creatures it spawns.\n\\* Whenever a player clears a round, they will be rewarded with a type of NFT: Creature wave.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\* Dormant Land Create to Earn mechanics:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\* Land owners can customize their Dormant Lands with NFT Creature waves and various obstacle farmed from Infested Lands.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\* Land Owner charge X amount of $SPIZE to whoever that joins to play their Dormant Land.\n\\* There will be a number of Teams players will have to form before a round starts.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\* The Land(map) will accumulate $SPIZE until a team successfully clear the round. Then the pool of $SPIZE will be shared among the teams who successfully clear the the round.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\* This mode encourages land NFT owners to make their Dormant Lands as challenging as possible. The harder their NFT lands are to clear. The more passive income they will get from players that will continuously attempt to clear them.\n\n \n\n\n"}', -- extra

To encourage this adoption, the tools built by the community will need clean, usable, understandable experiences that users without technical expertise can embrace and implement to add value for themselves. This challenge provides funding to directly address user experiences on Cardano.\n\n \n\n\nThree \"E''s\"\n\n \n\n\nThe overarching goal of this challenge is to promote the three \"E''s\" that will help to grow a non-technical user base on Cardano. New tools should Entertain, Educate, and/or Excite new users to adopt the technology. Much like social media was the \"killer\" app that further connected users to each other, we must seek out the new experiences that users will add to their lives because it makes their lives better. This time, we''ll do it without the other E: Exploitation.\n\n \n\n\nUsability Metrics\n\n \n\n\nProjects should build their interfaces with focus on ensuring ease of task completion. A user should want to grab this tool to solve the problem that they are experiencing, because the tool is easy to use and allows the user to complete their task. \n\n \n\n\nEngagement Metrics\n\n \n\n\nProjects that embrace these metrics need to ensure that the user is there because they want to be there, not because they are locked in to the experience. Agency is important. Success in this metric could also show a reduction in engagement, if it means the user is improving their overall experience.\n\n \n\n\nConversion Metrics\n\n \n\n\nUsers will share tools that improve their experience. Projects that embrace these metrics should focus on improvements that users want to recommend to their peers. \n\n \n\n\n", "importance": "The future of blockchain tech is building out the experiences that users want in their lives, while leaving them in control of their info.\n\n", "goal": "Experiences are built that draw a new user base that takes advantage of the underlying technology, while providing value in their lives.\n\n", "metrics": "The three core metrics of User Experience (UX) are usability, engagement, and conversion.

It requires a large scale solution for reform. What would be the motivation for middlemen to give farmers a better price?\n\nWhat is the farmer going to gain from the middleman taking their coffee? We could choose to alienate the initial buyers of the coffee, and produce solutions to egg them out of the system, but the middlemen are an untapped resource. They have knowledge about farmers, quality of coffee, history of coffee in their region and experience.\n\n \n\n\nCardano Coffee East Africa is a proposal to help everyone win. We are slowly going to empower East Africans (Farmers) to make more money from coffee production. We have a future proposal looking to put the whole production process on the Cardano blockchain. Increasing traceability in the Blockchain. For example Emurgo https://www.emurgo.io/en/blog/emurgo-traceability-solution-for-supply-chain-transparency-and-a-healthy-business-climate and what Cardano''s been able to do in Baia''s Orchard in Georgia. A Bean to Cup Process increasing value for the next generation to invest. Focusing on regenerative Farming processes by restoring dying farming processes.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/ZepYfsxi-xE?start=&t=17s \n\n\nWe are going to focus on Putting the \"middlemen\" on the blockchain using Atala PRISM. They can increase their rating/stars by completing courses on the Cardano Blockchain and Coffee Industry in the EAC. Farmers will seek them out (visit the website) and offer their coffee. We are proposing to the \"middlemen/Middlepeople\" the idea of being chosen by many farmers. This proposal will onboard and train the \"middlemen\" with future plans to do the same for the farmers. Similar to how Michelin star system gets customers to visit restaurants.\n\n \n\n\nThis process will have the effect of Involving SSI community: Data Centres: Bringing in Partnering with stakeholders in the SSI community. Population council, Ministries of Agriculture in Kenya Tanzania and Uganda.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nStakeholders:\n\nKenya: Coffee Directorate https://coffee.agricultureauthority.go.ke/\u00a0\n\nTanzania: MARKUP Tz https://www.eacmarkup.org/products/coffee\n\nUganda: Coffee Development Authority https://ugandacoffee.go.ug\n\n \n\n\nEngaging with these stakeholders will help position Cardano as one of the leaders in the SSI space in East Africa.

    '{"solution": "Our proposed solution is designed to attract new people from the millions that are pouring into cryptocurrency and empower them with information they are actively seeking.\u00a0A major barrier for the curious, but cautious future investor is the time and energy required to sort through the sea of information while deciphering how to safely and confidently navigate the crypto landscape without becoming overwhelmed. Each participant entering crypto through the CarPool Education System will be equipped with foundational knowledge and the skills to discern genuine opportunity from overblown hype. Each participant starts their crypto journey from the base camp of Cardano with the support of our community. This proposal aims to receive support for the initial launch of the CarPool education system that will bring new people to our rapidly growing ecosystem and equip them with a comprehensive understanding of crypto technology and the incredible value of Cardano.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPeople are seeing the world around them falter and are becoming more and more concerned about inflation, the devaluation of currencies, and the state of the market. Everyone is searching for alternate options. Looking for a new way to live. The question that keeps coming up over and over again, \u0093is it even possible to transition from working FOR someone else to working towards your\u00a0own financial freedom?\u0094 The answer is, YES! The key is to surround yourself with likeminded people. This is exactly what we are building, a learning accelerator joining newcomers to this community of like minded people who support one another. This is how you grow and thrive.\n\nCreating an interactive and comprehensive program like CarPool has been discussed and requested many times over the years within the Cardano community as well as outside of the community.\u00a0As more and more people have begun to realize how fragile, antiquated, and unsustainable the world\u0092s financial systems are, there has been a rapidly increasing number of people desperate to find reliable information on alternative investment solutions within the Crypto markets.\u00a0This is why the members of Carpool believe this is the perfect time to offer this program to the public.\u00a0The CarPool program will not only provide people with the initial knowledge they are seeking, but it will also provide them with an opportunity to become part of a bigger community of like-minded people who are working towards bigger goals as well as financial freedom.\n\n \n\n\nCarPool aims to become one of the most highly sought and reputable sources of interactive educational and informational content. CarPool and its partners have invested\u00a0thousands of hours of research, learning, and work so that CarPool students don\u0092t have to. Students are able to get started immediately in Cardano and grow their crypto knowledge and confidence on the platform.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nEnsuring sustainability, the CarPool Education System will incorporate multiple channels for contribution and partnership from within the community as it grows; beginning with an affiliate program for all Cardano SPOs that will bring delegations to the referring pools. CarPool is also looking to partner with other educators and content creators to grow a vibrant learning hub.\n\n \n\n\nWe have given careful consideration to each of the active Catalyst Campaigns and selected the Miscellaneous Challenge through a process of elimination. One other category that seemed to be a potential fit was the New Member Onboarding, however, the campaign metrics focus specifically around bringing people from the greater Cardano community to become actively involved within Catalyst. Providing education about Project Catalyst and onboarding into the platform is definitely an important piece of CarPool\u0092s full mission.\n\n \n\n\nKey Performance Indicators(KPI)/ Metrics:\n\nWe have set the following KPI\u0092s (Sales and Marketing, Operations, Instructors) based on our vision and mission.\u00a0\n\nVision:\u00a0Creating the Global standard in up-to-date, online, and in-person learning to onboard people into the Cardano ecosystem.\u00a0\n\nMission: Building a community of investors educated with a shared fundamental knowledge needed to successfully navigate the ever changing landscape of cryptocurrency.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nSales and Marketing KPI\u0092s:\n\n1. Cost per lead = (total marketing costs) / (total qualified leads)\n\n\\* Cost per lead is our most important metric and measured by our marketing strategy.\n\\* We aim to keep our cost per lead under $2.\n\n2. Average revenue per student\u00a0\n\n\\* Because we aim to create a community, the overall lifetime value of each student will shift as we continue to grow and offer new classes as well as bring in strategic partners from within the Cardano Ecosystem.\n\\* We have set a SLV (student lifetime value) projection of $597 to start.\n\n3. Leads: this metric reflects the number of leads acquired monthly and will give us the overall health of the company year over year.\u00a0\n\n4. Trial conversion: (trial = FREE initial class)\n\n\\* (Number of students attending FREE class) / (number of sign ups for class 2-9 )\n\n5. Students created:\n\n\\* A regular flow of students keeps any educational environment vibrant and also establishes a sense of competition.\n\n \n\n\nOperations KPI\u0092s:\n\n1. Attendance:\n\n\\* This metric measures the number of students attending each class.\n\n2. Churn rate % = (Students at the beginning) - (Students at the end) / (Students at the beginning)\u00a0\n\n\\* Because there are a number of competing education companies in the cryptocurrency space, this metric measures the percentage of students who stop attending in a certain period of time.\n\n3. Student loyalty - this is a score rating system implemented in each class.\u00a0\n\n\\* We will ask questions like: How likely are you to recommend us to your friends, family, and colleagues? Students will indicate their answers on a 10 point Likert scale, which increases accuracy. A score of 9-10 indicates a positive; 7-8 is neutral; 0-6 negative.\n\n \n\n\nInstructors KPI\u0092s:\n\n1. Hours: # of hours teaching\n\n\\* This metric tracks the operational side of our business and does not reflect pay scale.\n\n2. Student loyalty: These scores are given by students\n\n\\* The student loyalty score rating system surveys (also used in Operations KPI\u0092s)\u00a0will help us track this metric.\n\n3. Continuing Education:\u00a0\n\n\\* Instructors must stay abreast of new technology developments, news, and current events; each can cause markets to shift rapidly; and the regulatory environment is still in process of discovery.\n"}', -- extra

The purpose of funding is to focus on the first phase of the project for the next 3 months and undertake research for the DApp development and usability in Ghana. The research would increase participation among stakeholders in preparation for the DApp and usage.\n\n \n\n\nGhana is facing an acute housing challenge with a housing deficit standing at 2.4 million. Each day, an estimated number of over 1400 people are looking for houses to rent in both urban and rural communities. The search for accommodation/apartment and flats come with challenges especially, travelling from city to city, province to province, and from one community to another. The cost in travelling and dangers involved in commuting from one city to another is disheartening and a daunting task. In many cases these desperate individuals looking for rent fall in the hands of fraudsters.\n\n \n\n\nGetting the money for rent is not the problem but finding the right landlords and housing owners is the biggest threat. Many at times, rent allowances and fees are paid to scammers posing as apartment or flat owners. There are also rent agents charging exorbitant fees to view the accommodation/apartment/flats and often terms as Viewing Fees. The agent will further charge a 10% agent fee when one is interested in the house. The agents will first, inflate the rent fees, he takes the additional fees, and secondly ensure he makes another 10% on the actual fees.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nCreating a DApp will help eliminate fraudsters, middlemen charging exorbitant fees making rent more expensive in Ghana. House owners and individuals seeking accommodation/apartment/flats through a constructive verification process, would help both parties to freely negotiate terms to build trust and competence. DApp will bring together all home owners and individuals and groups looking for accommodation/apartment/flats/office space to rent. It will be a decentralized one stop shop. DApp will reduce cost, scammers and build trust in the rent and accommodation ecosystem. It will allow homeowners to list their homes on the DApp for visibility.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWe are partnered with Calogeron Ghana Limited, a construction and real estate firm and Procurement and Project Management Consultancy (PPMC) https://ppmcgroup.com/\u00a0\n\n"}', -- extra

In the same way, many Ethereum based developers and projects have founds out what Cardano is about and have gained interest in working on this network.\n\n\\* How can we develop a sustainable ecosystem while sharing knowledge and efforts?\n\n-This is basically all what my project is about.

Sharing knowledge is an ethical and moral obligation for scientists like me. We ensure that all the education we are providing is backed up by sources and up-to-date. We work really hard for giving TOP QUALITY education to the Cardano and blockchain community as a whole.\n\n"}', -- extra

By acting as an human sensor array, the Catalyst Circle is able to gather problems and bring those back to the community with a call to action to provide solutions to the presented problems. The Catalyst Circle itself, act only as a coordination and communication body, decisions are made by the community. This is the base of this proposal.

This action is coordinated and supported by the Catalyst Circle and the CC Admin team.\n\n \n\n\n(B) Proposal Submission\n\n \n\n\n(1) The final prioritized Problems are presented to the community with the call to action for solution-based implementation proposals\n\n(2) To encourage effective collaboration, the Community has five days to build action teams to solve the problem.\n\n(3) The submitted solutions are reviewed in a 2-day timeframe by the community members that will act as CAs\n\n(4) The highest-ranked proposal assessments are reviewed by the vCAs within three days\n\n(5) The highest-ranked proposed solutions receive the needed fundings to execute their proposals\n\n \n\n\nMechanism for dealing with multiple teams:\u00a0\n\n(1) The final prioritized problems are presented to the Community. The Circle will document the issues on the CC github board, and each case is \u0093owned\u0094 by a Catalyst Circle - Member. The \u0093Problem Owner\u0094 has to lead, coordinate and support the highest-ranked submitted proposal (5).\u00a0\n\n \n\n\n(2) The Community has a 5 day timeframe to build action teams looking to provide an effective solution on the presented problem, to coordinate the available skill sets in the community and to create or to use networks that bring in the required missing skills.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\n(3) The submitted solutions are reviewed in a 2-day timeframe from the catalyst community advisors, who will act as CAs out of the conventional CAs activity phase in the Project Catalyst - Assessment phase. The Catalyst Circle - Funding Mechanism allows us to explore new cases of evolution for the Community Advisors. It will enable us to gather a maximum of assessments on a low amount of proposals.

Each component entity, individually as well as all in totality, are focused on the following key directions as outlined in the challenge brief:\u00a0\n\n \n\n\n\\* Education for development in the Cardano & Catalyst ecosystem\n\\* Developing common tools, frameworks, core infrastructures, or proof of concepts\n\\* Common audited repositories & overviews of existing solutions\n\\* Organizing events to bring the development ecosystem together\n\\* Collaboration to improve interoperability within the ecosystem\n\n \n\n\nEducation for development in the Cardano & Catalyst ecosystem\n\n \n\n\nThe proposal will address education for development in the Cardano and Catalyst ecosystems by building the capacity of each of the Catalyst stakeholder groups represented by the Circle in identifying, developing, and testing out governance solutions. Through this iterative process, the Circle will directly engage large sections of the community to better understand their challenges while gathering their ideas for how to address them. This will help ensure that the entire community becomes active in the creation and operationalization of solutions, thereby raising the overall education and expertise levels of the community. Interested community members can expect updates from the Circle during weekly town halls and various Catalyst-related events.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nThe CC Admin Team also addresses education and development of the Cardano and Catalyst ecosystems by fulfilling necessary administrative and information roles to ensure that the community has consistent access to the workings of the Circle. The CC Admin Team attends all CC meetings and is responsible for the facilitating and note taking of the meeting. The team tracks action items, circle member commitments, and helps build bridges into community learning through activities such as Election Fest and Governance Day. The CC Admin Team also works closely with the Quality-Assurance DAO (a separate oversight body) to ensure that the information collected and relayed to the community is accurate and easily accessible. Through these activities, the CC Admin Team, in collaboration with other Circle entities, are engaged in iterative knowledge production and reproduction so that it, and the wider ecosystem, are in a continual state of learning and knowledge transfer.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nThe CC Treasurers play an integral role in education for development in the Cardano and Catalyst ecosystems by developing and implementing accounting and reporting structures that are transparent, so that the community can easily see where the money allotted for governance is being spent. Even though they comprise a new team, the CC Treasurers have quickly managed to create an accounting system through github that is open source, so that payments going in and out are tracked, and over the next funding cycle, will work to automate this tool where appropriate. In addition, the CC Treasurers are developing, \u0093treasury as a service\u0094 so the broader community can take the model developed by the CC Treasurers and apply it (with CC Treasurer\u0092s help) to their own context, further reproducing the information and knowledge through this initiative.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nThe Mentors also have a crucial role in education for development in the Cardano and Catalyst ecosystems but creating a network of previous circle members who provide invaluable assistance to new cohorts, and assisting in the distribution of Circle-related activities and information. The value of the Mentors within the governance proposal is to provide a streamlined transition process from one Circle to the next. Previous iterations of the Circle, without mentors, were not able to mobilize as quickly during the start of their term, and by introducing mentors, many of the lessons learned from previous iterations are shared and applied more immediately.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nDeveloping common tools, frameworks, core infrastructures, or proof of concepts\n\n \n\n\nA key function of each of the groups above, is to create tooling, frameworks, infrastructures, and then test them in real world settings to determine their effectiveness and success. Some examples of common tools, frameworks, and core infrastructures that are already under develop or actively being employed by the Circle, CC Admin Team, CC Treasurers, and Mentors are:\n\n \n\n\n\\* Open source Github meeting documentation repository\n\\* Open source Github problem sensing board\n\\* Open source accounting system with tracking and reporting system for funding acquisition and dispensing\n\\* Training to other\n\\* Process guidance for documenting and implementing Catalyst Circle elections\n\\* Development of a CC Admin Team playbook which will outline all processes, documents, and procedures for running the Catalyst Circle and its administrative requirements.\n\n \n\n\nCommon audited repositories & overviews of existing solutions\n\n \n\n\nAs highlighted in the previous section, the Catalyst Circle, CC Admin Team, and the CC Treasurers have committed to using only open source tooling, unless no open source tool exists. By having this commitment at the forefront, the community can have confidence in being able to access the information and review it for themselves. This is an important part of our ethos as we strive to grow governance in a community-driven, community-centric way.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nBy keeping the process transparent in an open source fashion, each problem only needs to be solved once and added to the repository for other community members to see, and if appropriate put into action. This is the joy of open source. We believe that by maximizing the community\u0092s collective brainpower we are much likelier to be successful through a spirit of collaboration, instead of competition. By working together we can achieve our goals much faster than by each going our separate ways. We believe that this is true to the essence of Catalyst writ-large and therefore is a foundational component of our Ethos.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nOrganizing events to bring the development ecosystem together\n\n \n\n\nAt its very core, the Catalyst Circle and the CC Admin Team are designed to bridge the gaps that exist across the development ecosystem and work towards our collective challenge of community governance. One core function of both of these groups is to bring people together, raise awareness across the different stakeholder groups, and garner as much community feedback as is possible. One could consider that each time the Circle meets, it is achieving this objective, for Circle meetings are a rare space where each stakeholder group is represented across mutual challenges and identifies potential solutions. As a central entity, there can be deep conversations on issues facing one or more of the Catalyst communities.\n\n \n\n\nThe CC Admin Team takes this one step further by supporting Circle members in their engagement with their constituents and by facilitating and implementing the nomination and election of new Circle members. We also garner feedback from all participants during our governance day events to learn and improve for the next iteration. The CC Admin Team also plays a very present role in after town halls in support of the Catalyst Swarm, where diverse groups of community members come together to discuss myriad issues.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nCollaboration to improve interoperability within the ecosystem\n\n \n\n\nIt is only through collaboration that the Catalyst Circle, CC Admin Team, CC Treasurers, and Mentors are able to improve interoperability within the system by ensuring that the governance layer of Project Catalyst is representative of all stakeholder groups and a broad diversity of voices. As we tear down silos between each of the key groups, the community is better able to hear and understand each other, to clarify points of confusion and find solutions, and in doing so, strengthen the ties between the communities themselves. Since each of the members of the governance teams wear multiple hats across their roles, they can also gain a deeper insight into the different requirements and supports for each community.\u00a0\n\n"}', -- extra

    '{"solution": "The proposed solution meets the \u0093minimum viable hub\u0094 criteria by keeping the cost model as low as possible by maximizing the reach and impact of our efforts. We do this through several mechanisms:\n\n \n\n\n1. We favor online events over face-to-face events. While face-to-face events are valuable and something we do, we prefer to host online events to reach a greater audience. Online events also facilitate the recording of the event so those that could not attend are able to watch at a later date, further increasing the impact and reach of the event. See our recorded Pacific Town Halls as an example:\n2. We publish materials using a combination of open source and Creative Commons licenses, which allows the community to have free and open access to our materials, and the ability to re-mix, extend and use those materials as they see fit. See our Github repository for examples: https://github.com/Salmon-Nation-Decentralized-Alliance\n3. We strive for long-term sustainability. SANADA has a stake pool that is intended to help long-term sustainability for the organization. We currently have over 300K ADA in live stake and are actively minting blocks. The funding requests in this proposal are intended to help us bridge the gap to sustainability by funding our community managers, event organizers, and human networking operations while we continue to market and build up the stake pool.\n4. A potential avenue to help sustainability is the creation of a paid course that will go beyond our free online and in-person educational events, provide more in-depth information on a variety of topics and provide a revenue stream to pay for operational expenses.\n5. We have a distributed team who can work from anywhere in the region, so we do not have large carrying costs for office space. For our primary Victoria hub, we use a co-working space for our primary office and networking space instead of renting a permanent office: https://www.clubkwench.com/en. A physical presence is important to have a place people can find you, and working from a co-working space facilitates serendipitous discovery and connections with other people that work in that space.\n6. We are actively building a community. We do this through a combination of in-person and online events, outreach to the local community through Q&A seminars, and joining events for people who are \u0093crypto-curious\u0094. A strong community is the heart of a successful hub and is a source of volunteers to help scale what the hub can achieve. We are also building our online community and have our Discord server here: https://discord.gg/JG7N3cV9fw.\n7. We network locally with other blockchain groups. In addition to building our local and online community, we also reach out to and attend other blockchain meetups and events and leverage these existing groups as opportunities to evangelize Cardano and attract people to the community, getting knowledge to people who would otherwise not have had the opportunity to ask questions and get to know what we have to offer as a more energy-efficient blockchain and the exciting possibilities of governance and participation in Project Catalyst.\n\n \n\n\nThe target audience for SANADA is people in the Salmon Nation bioregion who are looking to use Cardano blockchain technology to solve local and regional problems. We seek to onboard new people to Project Catalyst and to help them become successful community members. A secondary audience is those that are in neighboring regions who find events happening in the Pacific timezones convenient (USA, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Pacific Islanders, etc.).\n\n \n\n\nSANADA is closely affiliated with Cardano4Climate and the emerging Cardano Impact Collective and biases towards topics and projects related to sustainability and impact. We seek, through our efforts, to help the world solve its many critical challenges through the creative application of blockchain technology, decentralized governance, self-sovereignty, and recreating a more fair and sustainable financial infrastructure for tomorrow.\n\n"}', -- extra

The first sentence at Cardano.org is \u0093making the world work better for all\u0094 and you can see this line in practically every video of Mr. Charles Hoskinson as well as many of the Cardano ecosystem activities.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFollowing fund 6 we have conducted the research matching Catalyst proposals with SDGs and the results were very promising. This research showed that 27.5% of the funded proposals directly connect to impact the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and 68.5% indirectly connect to impact the SDGs. This is not a surprise as blockchain technology has the potential to have an impact on financial inclusion, governance, education, and other areas which comply with SDGs objectives.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nImpact-driven businesses (or the transformation of the business to have a greater societal impact) are a major business strategy today. It has become a norm for large corporations, multinationals, and many small and medium-sized enterprises to have\u00a0\u0091Social and environmental\u0092 focused departments, with such focus growing in importance for many stakeholders.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMany corporate financial reports show this growing trend. An example is Nestle\u0092s 2020 annual financial report (the summary already includes some key relevant information), which highlights that Nestle\u0092s internal stakeholders see climate and decarbonization, innovative business models, and digital technology as having a major impact on Nestle\u0092s success: https://www.nestle.com/sites/default/files/2021-03/2020-annual-review-en.pdf\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is a huge opportunity for Cardano to maintain its leadership in philosophy, technology, and initiatives that support the growing number of government projects, investor sentiment, and company initiatives aiming to \u0093make this world better for all\u0094.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nUnited Nations India says \u0093A successful sustainable development agenda requires partnerships between governments, the private sector, and civil society.\u0094\n\n \n\n\nCollaboration and partnerships are key to achieving the SDGs by 2030. It is the avenue by which we co-produce impactful solutions to wicked problems. Creating a space for these collaborations to take place, and designing a new framework to receive qualified leads, will help the global society work towards the successful implementation of the sustainable development agenda which is so critical to our continued thriving on this planet.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo that end, this proposal is being submitted by many of the existing Cardano and Project Catalyst community impact networks who are coming together to form the Cardano Impact Collective.

    '{"brief": "As we approach the Voltaire era of the Cardano roadmap, https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/voltaire/ the governance of Project Catalyst will be transitioned from IOG to the Catalyst community itself.\n\n \n\n\nIf we are to be ready for Voltaire, we need to bring together in a coherent fashion the many disparate experiments that have been launched in Catalyst to develop and test infrastructure for decentralised and distributed governance. We need to develop consensus on how these experiments, teams, and tools fit together and consider how community members get involved and use them.\n\n \n\n\nThis kind of cohesiveness demands a novel approach; so this challenge is unlike any other in Catalyst\u0092s history.\n\n \n\n\nThe aim of this challenge setting is to create \\*new\\* collaborations between previous proposers (successfully funded or not) on decentralised governance issues. So, to propose in this challenge, your proposal team must:\n\n \n\n\n1. include team members from at least two different decentralised-governance-related proposals from a previous funding round\n2. include links to the relevant previous proposals\n3. explain the reasons for this collaboration, what each side brings to it, and how it will work.\n\n \n\n\nThe aim of this approach is to counteract fragmentation and draw together the existing thinking in the ecosystem to help us build what we need. We can only become ready for distributed governance if we work together.\n\n \n\n\nDecentralised-governance-related proposals from a previous funding round includes (but is not limited to) projects about:\n\n \n\n\n\\* Strategy and decision-making\n\\* Administration\n\\* Policies, operating procedures, and protocols\n\\* Recruiting, supporting, and resourcing good people to do governance work\n\\* Service array and service delivery systems link to governance\n\\* Information systems and data support\n\\* Evaluation, quality assurance, and continuous quality improvement systems\n\\* Communication systems (for governance with the community)\n\\* Communication systems (external)\n\\* Research, analysis, learning, and reports on distributed and decentralised governance\n", "importance": "As we approach the Voltaire era of the Cardano roadmap, the community needs to collaborate to take responsibility for Catalyst governance.\n\n", "goal": "The Cardano community is actively collaborating across silos to develop new and coherent approaches to governance, participation, and power.\n\n", "metrics": "* Is the proposal a collaboration between two governance-related proposers (funded or unfunded) from a previous Fund? Does the proposal demonstrate this by including links to at least two past proposals by members of the team?\n* Does the proposal show evidence that the proposers have thought about why they are collaborating, what they each bring, and how their collaboration will work in practical terms?\n* Capability \u0096 does the proposal team demonstrate they have knowledge of the Catalyst community, and an understanding of governance issues?\n* Who is involved - will the proposal help ensure that decision-making power is more widely distributed, and that structural exclusions (by geography, by gender, by first language, by economic power, etc) are challenged?\n* Does the proposal create opportunities for genuinely new approaches? Are traditional assumptions about leaders, hierarchies, the link between wealth and power, and who can be meaningfully involved in governance being challenged, and does the proposal move us towards more decentralised structures and tools?\n"}', -- extra

These will, in turn, help with the evolution of the Cardano ecosystem. From simple tools to complex governance. It will a provide more effective evolution of the software systems upon which they are based. A Collaboration platform will particularly help in the development of complex projects requiring a variety of disciplines working toward a common goal.\n\n \n\n\nCapturing and Evolving Community Intentions ensures that future efforts are in tune with past. Capturing shared objectives gives the big picture help for the alignment of all efforts.\n\nA community wide view of prospective projects help to make visible the need for engagement of expert attention and provides for a more sustainable ecosystem for collecting knowledge.\n\nProject Collaboration Tools will:\n\n\\* Lever the development of all projects at lower risk\n\\* Accelerate the creation of proof-of-concepts, common tools, frameworks, and core infrastructures.\n\\* Provides improved interoperability of Open-Source tools within the ecosystem.\n\n \n\n\nOpen Source for Continuous Improvement\n\nThe current HYPE Innovation Management Platform is currently Closed-Source. Our collaboration with HYPE is arranging for the licensing of core functionality under a perpetual licence. Utilizing this core we will provide Open-Source Development on-top for all Cardano developed extensions.\n\nWe, therefore, use a closed-source foundation but provide an Open-Source environment to expand the features and evolve more full featured solutions.\n\n \n\n\nWhy is this project Important?\n\nThe proposed Collaborative Platform once fully developed will provide dramatic improvements in both quality and quantity of Open-Source Development Projects by improving community ecosystem contribution, growth, and the development of collaborative project expertise.\n\n \n\n\nKey Metrics\n\nThe proposed community collaboration program is designed to provide:\n\n\\* An increase in the Quantity and the Quality of Cardano Open-Source projects\n\\* Greater Community Engagement to increase the number of project contributors\n\\* More open-source tools, frameworks, and projects in alignment with community intentions\n\n \n\n\nIn future funding rounds, we aim to continue these collaborations and develop more useful collaborative products honoring the knowledge and practices we are researching, developing, re-sharing and capturing.

Our solution will create an educational resource that help Latin American developers more easily write and deploy smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain and accordingly, increase the adoption of the Cardano blockchain in Latin America.\n\n \n\n\nThe higher the quality of educational resources, the faster developers can be engaged and create applications with a high level of quality and security.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThe European Business University of Luxembourg (EBU) is a non-profit organisation that designs and develops educational products and services that put in the hands of students tools connected to real-world problems, with professors and human talent of the highest academic and professional level that transpire what is happening in the world.\n\n \n\n\nIn its educational work in developing countries, the University has prioritised access to education over economic costs. Its intensive scholarship programme, in which students pay only a minimal tuition fee ($20 EUR is the current rate) for certificate courses in the areas of business and technology, has enabled it to position itself as a reliable educational provider in countries in Africa, East Asia and Latin America (see graph below \"EBU Scholarship Demographics - By Country\").\n\n \n\n\nIn Latin America our Spanish language courses in business areas are well known, and now, with IOG as our partner, we are ready to bring Cardano''s technical knowledge to Latin America, just as we have done in countries such as Kenya and Nigeria.\n\n"}', -- extra

    '{"solution": "Specialists in regulation, lawyers, and politicians: The research and writing team are professionals in law, legal scholarship, public finance, policy, blockchains, and software engineering.\u00a0\n\nAppropriate and effective regulation is essential to open and free societies that adhere to rule-of-law. Like the Internet and the Web before, Blockchain technology challenges the effectiveness and applicability of legal regulations. Compared to prior technologies, by design Blockchain networks have one distinctive feature, they facilitate transactions across jurisdictions[6]. Cryptocurrencies, Fungible and Non-Fungible Tokens, DeFi, and DAOs all challenge the existing legal order in different ways, thus are considered alegal[4] - pushing and pulling at the boundaries of legal systems. However, it is difficult for legal regimes to adapt to alegal technologies. Through our unique mix of experience (senior government/legal/technical) and via consultation across our professional networks, the research team aims to provide a pathway for regulators to navigate the alegality of blockchain in a way that supports perminissionless innovation.\n\n \n\n\nA positive environment for adoption: We face significant social and envirnomental challenges now and into the future. If we want to live on spaceship earth[7], the change has to occur from the centre and at the edge. Our moon-shot is to figure out how to enable more effective local change by bringing impact investment to Cardano. Using tokens and market mechanisms, Blockchains can enable new operational forms of common and public good financing[8]. Using new digital capital allocation approaches to finance networked organisations (DAOs) and develop digital Public-Private Partnerships[9] that drive social and environmental change. Despite the potential for financial and regulatory transparency offered by Cardano, financial market regulations can make financing social and environmental impact programmes too cumbersome to pursue efficiently.\n\n \n\n\nCollaboration key to creating favourable regulatory environment(s): One approach to solve the tension is to create experimental regulation[10], carve out exemptions, or both; Time-boxed legal regimes for regulatory experiments based on legal effectiveness, evidence-based lawmaking, temporary legislation, and regulatory innovation. Such sandboxes are often explored in the compliance heavy financial sector[11], although they are applicable in many other domains too.\n\n \n\n\nProof-of-Stake (PoS) and Cardano: Blockchain technology and Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)[6] have affordances that can significantly lower the burden of regulatory oversight, disclosures, and reporting[12]. High-assurance 3rd Generation Blockchain Networks such as Cardano also provide a much stronger guarantee of information integrity, which is necessary for regulators. Cardano''s commitment to Patent-free, Open-Source Software, Proof-of-Stake \\*green\\* consensus mechanisms[13], and concrete moves towards decentralised community governance, also provide arguments for sustainable long-term operation needed for digital public infrastructure. These are all a reasonable basis to experiment with regulations in public and common good financial innovation.\n\n \n\n\nAdoption of Cardano in jurisdictions: The blueprint\u0092s focus is on New Zealand regulation, an APEC Commonweath country with a common law jurisdiction. As a founding member of the Digital Nations[14], New Zealand Government initiatives are often exemplars for other Governments to follow [15]. It is a small country that considently ranks 1st for ease of doing business, high transparency, and low corruption. The legal-order is progressively blending western and indigenous (M?ori) jurisprudence which highlights a willingness for legal innovation.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nThe medium-term goal is simple: get New Zealand market regulator and tax authority to acquiescent to regulatory experiments for impact investment. With longer-term potential for the New Zealand Government to export its trusted jurisdiction, through Blockchain technology, to other countries[8][16].\n\n"}', -- extra

They help to prevent duplicate challenge settings, remove challenges created by self interest, reduce the need for deep knowledge of the ecosystem from challenge proposal teams and also removes an easy entry point for malicious actors.\n\n \n\n\nThe full documentation for Catalyst Funding Categories can be found here: https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-funding-categories\n\n \n\n\n7 funding categories have been documented to cover all forms of ideas and proposals.

This provides a less competitive environment for teams to find initial funding to nurture their growth and evolution.\n\n \n\n\nThis category can be seen as an on ramp for new ideas and teams for trying things out something and showing the community what they are capable of achieving.\n\n \n\n\nThe more ideas and exploration the community can nurture the faster the ecosystem can learn from and develop better solutions.

    '{"solution": "The most important mechanism to achieve our ambitious goals and KPIs is our diverse, experienced, and dedicated team. Our team is working under strictly defined tasks and responsibilities for each member. Daily and weekly meetings are taking place since August 2021, when the project began, and continue more rigorously as we come closer to the launch date.\n\n \n\n\nThe head of all operations and the final decision maker is the CEO George Chrysochou. His main task is to assign, moderate, and coordinate the entire team to complete daily, weekly, and monthly tasks and ensure the project meets its goals and objectives.\n\n \n\n\nEach team member must invest a minimum of 8 hours of work during weekdays (with 9+ hours being optimal) and 5 hours of work during weekends. A Google spreadsheet is available for each team member where each completed task and the workouts should be recorded daily.\n\n \n\n\nThe responsibilities for each team member are defined in the private tasks lists found in the project\u0092s proprietary drive data. The COO is responsible for overseeing the minimum required daily tasks/hours and reporting to the CEO. The CEO is responsible for supervising the COO\u0092s own daily tasks/hours.\n\n \n\n\nAll code development tasks are managed by the CTO, Giorgos Georgiou, and a team of part-time developers and contractors.\n\n \n\n\nThe main design team comprises Olko Vladi, the Lead Character Designer, and Katerina Kuparadze, the Lead Graphic Designer. Evros Neofytides, the Lead Web Designer, provides additional design assistance on demand.\n\n \n\n\nThe marketing team comprises all main team members, which are assigned daily marketing responsibilities and their regular duties. All marketing activities are monitored via productivity sheets and custom CRM implementations.\n\n \n\n\nThis level of organizational structure ensures that our team will stay on track with our weekly tasks, milestones, deadlines, and processes. Every week, the CEO monitors and adjusts the weekly tasks with the assistance of all other team members.\n\n \n\n\n\\*Marketing Strategy\\*\n\n \n\n\nThe core of our marketing strategy is based on five pillars:\n\n1. Influencer marketing\n2. Email outreach\n3. PPC advertising\n4. Contests\n5. Community building\n\n \n\n\n\\*1. Influencer marketing:\\*\n\nInfluencer marketing includes paid and free mentions from NFT, CNFT, and cryptocurrency space authorities.\n\n \n\n\nOur marketing team has carefully created a detailed list of more than 2,000 NFT & Crypto influencers primarily active on Twitter and Youtube, and to a lesser extent on Tik Tok, Instagram, Facebook, and Linkedin.\n\n \n\n\nWe have been gathering promotional cost info for each influencer by reaching out to them over several months.\n\n \n\n\nWe then analyze their engagement metrics -including formulas for engagement rates, bot or inactive accounts percentage, activity rate, effective audience, reputation scores - and allocate our influencer budget accordingly.\n\n \n\n\n\\*2. Email outreach:\\*\n\nEmail outreach efforts are categorized into two main phases:\n\n \n\n\nThe first phase is creating extensive, manually researched email lists of the thousands of websites related to the following niches: NFT, crypto, news media, social causes, social justice, NGO, gender equality, gender rights, etc.\n\n \n\n\nThe second phase is manually outreaching to those websites utilizing every email account and team member. We simply present our project and its social impact potential and share our media packages in our outreach attempts. We are also open to participating in interviews, events, contests, and partnership deals if the parties'' goals and code of conduct align.\n\n \n\n\n\\*3. PPC advertising\\*\n\nOur team consists of two directors of two Google Partners agencies, who collectively have more than 20 years of experience in Pay Per Click (PPC) advertising.\n\n \n\n\nThe PPC campaign will focus primarily on branding campaigns via Google Display Advertising, Google Search Advertising, Facebook Advertising, and to a smaller scale by using Twitter, Linkedin, Reddit, and Instagram.\n\n \n\n\nIn such campaigns, the main aspects of the project will be communicated with static and animated banners, shown to a carefully targeted user demographic of NFT and crypto enthusiasts.\n\n \n\n\n\\*4. Contests\\*\n\nGender Unicorns will run regular contests to expand our user base and reward our most active and valuable members. Such contests will require meaningful community contributions, such as being an active participant in the dedicated gender channels, having a high number of positive mentions among the community, inviting a high number of relevant people in the community, publishing and sharing valuable content, taking the initiative for helping any associated social cause and charities, or any other related activity that helps strengthen the community and aligns with our social impact objectives.\n\n \n\n\nThe rewards for those contests will be:\n\n\\* Pinklisting spots (limited to a maximum of 2 NFTs per individual)\n\\* monetary rewards in $ADA\n\\* exclusive moderator roles on our community channels such as discord\n\\* exclusive access to private community channels\n\\* voting rights to important project decisions\n\\* exclusive access to new iterations of the Gender Battles\n\\* exclusive positions within the Gender Alliances, and\n\\* perks defined upon community polls.\n\n \n\n\n\\*5. Community building\\*\n\nOur most prized asset is our community; therefore, we must ensure that it is built on a solid, safe, and respectful foundation that will allow us to scale our reach and maximize our impact.\n\n \n\n\nSeveral automated qualitative and quantitative systems and structures will be placed to give recognition, rights, and rewards to the most reputable, active, and respectful community members. A bottom-up management system will be applied in selecting community moderators as their powers will depend on their reputation. The community will vote for which moderators and community speakers should be promoted via periodic polls.\n\n \n\n\nFurthermore, the status and reputation of members who wish to enter the safelist or moderator team will also be verified via engagement metrics, discord bots, activity reports, and manual reviews by the moderators. Every safelist or moderator approval will require the agreement of the majority of the relevant moderating teams. If there is no consensus, an application can be re-examined after 1 week upon request.\n\n \n\n\nMost importantly, we wish our community members to feel free to express themselves in their way and meet and exchange ideas and thoughts with others in a respectful environment. Everyone can join our discussion events and create a live call through our servers. We plan to bring regular speakers that will discuss gender diversity issues, among other topics, and encourage each of our members to join in and create their events.\n\n \n\n\nOnce those systems take place, we expect our Community to have the largest impact on our growth via viral marketing and word of mouth. This will be the true catalyst that will bring our project worldwide recognition.\n\n"}', -- extra

    '{"solution": "This proposal addresses the challenge by \"meeting people where they are\", and engaging them with Cardano through what they are already interested in - in this case, philosophy. It engages primarily working-class people, who would not otherwise be likely to get the opportunity to engage with the issues around Cardano.\n\n \n\n\nIt will engage at a local level in Liverpool, with facilitators who know the Liverpool PIPS community well, and will use Liverpool PIPs as a starting point for a \"minimum viable Hub\". It will establish cross-community engagement between PIPs and Catalyst through the fact that PIPs members are already confident at engaging online with philosophical ideas, and will simply need to build their knowledge of blockchain-related issues. Engaging people with Cardano through something they are already passionate about, so that they are not passive \u0093newbies\u0094 but are able to bring something of value, is likely to lead to better onboarding for the participants; and having a group of new people onboarded who are inspired by philosophical enquiry and keen to engage, will stimulate the growth of philosophical enquiry and discussion within Catalyst. The \u0093MVH\u0094 outcome of an embryonic Hub with roots in both the Catalyst community and in the grassroots community of PIPs, makes use of the existing resources and infrastructure of both communities, and will be stronger and more diverse than trying to build a hub based in just one of them.\n\n \n\n\nNote 1: Scaling Down The original (Fund7) version of this proposal (https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/383504) suggested creating and designing a learning resource or playbook to engage community philosophy groups across the UK. But in the light of the new approach for this challenge setting, and the need to \u0093scale down\u0094, we have decided it is best to focus this proposal on simply initiating the Philosophy Hub, and creating a space for it to grow organically. Our initial research showed there is demand for a learning resource/playbook; creating one could perhaps be a focus for a future funding proposal led by PIPs themselves, which would have the additional positive effect of onboarding them as proposers.\n\n \n\n\nNote 2: Minimum Viable Hub and Cost-To-Launch Ratio In line with this Challenge Setting''s ideal that proposals should only aim for a \"Minimum Viable Hub\", this project''s budget is roughly one-fifth of the costs we envisage to launch and fully establish a philosophy-focused Hub that can fully engage long-term with developments in the philosophy of blockchain. The \"Minimum Viable Hub\" prioritises community philosophy, but with potential to develop in the future towards academia as well, thanks to PIPs'' organisational links with University philosophy departments in various universities. \n\n \n\n\nOur projected costs to full launch are:\n\nThis Minimum Viable Hub ($18.6k); co-writing, producing and promoting a self-guide learning resource/playbook on Cardano and philosophy ($10k); translating the resource into 2 languages to engage community philosophy networks in other countries ($4k); ongoing engagement and onboarding activities with c. 10 community philosophy groups worldwide ($18k); developing the Ekphrasis GitBook in the longer term: using it to research, document and disseminate new research in the philosophy of blockchain, and establishing it as a trusted resource in both the academic and community philosophy worlds ($18k); remunerating facilitators to research, devise, lead and document regular engagement sessions in Catalyst about the philosophy behind Cardano, including new and ongoing research underpinning the key Catalyst governance changes that will be forthcoming in 2022 and 2023 ($22k)\n\nTotal c. $90.6k; so this proposal, at $18.6k, is approximately one-fifth of the total cost to establish a solid, thriving Cardano Philosophy Hub that fully engages Catalyst, academia, and community philosophy networks worldwide.\n\n"}', -- extra

This may in part explain the lack of a Marketing budget as stated in the referenced Abstract.\n\n \n\n\nCharles, in other chats has explained the importance of this years third quarter and the work on projects coming due this fall ( harvest season for farmers).\n\n\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\u0097\n\nThis Challenge setting proposal, suggests it is time to meet the importance and need stated in The Treasury Abstract for a Marketing category.

It is time for the community to take the lead in meeting the need, stated in The Treasury Report, by budgeting money for Marketing. And, help the growth throughout the Cardano ecosystem.

The six essential categories if evenly funded would be set at $3.3 mil each with a $20 mil Challenge budget. $4,000,000 would equate to the greatest percentage.

    '{"brief": "Cities and towns are more and more important today. Globally, over 50% of the world''s population lives in urban areas today. By 2045, the world''s urban population will increase by 1.5 times to 6 billion [1]. Cities play an increasingly important role in tackling climate change because their exposure to climate and disaster risk increases as they grow. Around 90% of urban expansion in developing countries is near hazard-prone areas and built through informal and unplanned settlements [2]. Besides, cities are also at the frontline of combating epidemics [2]. City governments in developing countries are finding pilot blockchain projects on the urban scale as proof of experiment for related policy proposals of blockchain adoption.\n\nAs a result, there are various problems in cities that waiting to be solved by applying blockchain technology in general, and Cardano blockchain, in particular. Integrating Cardano into regional and urban level projects can strongly support:\n\n1. The faster adoption of Cardano in reality.\n2. The enforcement of UN\u0092s Sustainable Development Goals, especially the following goals:\n\\* 7. Affordable and Clean Energy\n\\* 8. Decent Work and Economic Growth\n\\* 9. Industrial Innovation and Infrastructure\n\\* 11. Sustainable Cities and Communities.\n\nThe potential for Cardano blockchain technology to reduce administrative expenses involved with urban planning might save cities a lot of money. Finally, blockchain technology has the potential to increase community participation through secure, easily-accessible voting systems pertaining to urban and regional planning decisions.\n\n \n\n\n\\*Possible directions\\*\n\nSolutions for applying Cardano, especially Defi and NFT into solving urban problems of the developing world, including\n\n\\* Events with experts (from Think Tanks, city''s agencies, city leaders, smart city developers,...) to introduce and discuss how Cardano may serve and integrate into their scheme for smart cities, innovation city,...\n\\* Affordable housing development; Crowdfunding for financing urban services; Land, property, and housing management (through tokenization of urban land, housing, and other assets).\n\\* Solution of Mobility payment and other solutions for improving public transit\n\\* Solution for Urban planning and urban management\n\\* Energy / Water / Pollution Management\n\\* Green Building: solutions, certificates (NFTs,...),...\n\\* Smart city, Smart buildings,...\n\n \n\n\nThis proposed budget for this challenge can not be enough for massive projects but may serve as seeds for initiatives to grow in cities.\n\nWe had scientists, experts, communitiy members who have common interest in this theme.\n\nThis challenge may serve as a bridge to connect Cardano to existing agendas, strategies, master plans,... of urban governments in developing countries\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\*Source of Citation\\*\n\n[1] https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/urbandevelopment/overview#1\n\n[2] https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/urbandevelopment/overview#1\n\n", "importance": "Cities are the growth engines of economies.\n\nCity leaders need to see the Cardano-based projects on an urban scale for further adoption.\n\n", "goal": "Cardano is integrated into the development programs, strategies, and urban scale projects in developing cities for application.\n\n", "metrics": "At the end of this challenge, we will be asking ourselves some questions about\n\n* The number of proposals for integrating Cardano into development programs, strategies, and urban scale projects in developing countries.\n* The number of events organized for introducing Cardano to Cities'' governments/agencies.\n* The number of development programs, strategies, and urban projects have Cardano integrated for application.\n* The observed impact of funded projects (meeting their KPIs).\n* Is there good feedback on funded project progress, failure, or success, that helps us understand the issues of deploying Cardano solutions across cities?\n"}', -- extra

    '{"solution": ">>>\n\n \n\n\nBlockchain is hard. Cardano is harder. Integrating between different blockchains is hardest. Figuring out where to go, who to contact, and what resources are reliable in your integration and partnership journey is a near impossibility.\n\n \n\n\nIn order for adoption to grow, developers and business users alike need reliable information on which projects are out there, who is behind them, and which of their sources are authoritative from the perspective of the project owners.\n\n \n\n\nUltimately this authoritative list should be, at the option of the project owner, committed to the blockchain in the event that the project owner would like to stake an indefinite ownership to a particular virtual asset associated with a project.\n\n \n\n\nThis demonstration of commitment also enables prospective and partner developers a higher degree of confidence in committing resources to a particular set of API or integration procedures\n\n \n\n\nCross-chain collaboration is key to gaining and expanding market-share for Cardano and creating value for Ada holders. The reality is, Web3 application development is moving beyond the silo of blockchain specific thinking to business solution thinking.\n\n \n\n\nBy facilitating the ability to integrate with and seek integration for on-going projects, it allows the ecosystem of ideas to flourish with minimal duplication. If there exists a successful application that is operating on a specific chain, the developers goal will increasingly become how to integrate with that existing application or how to be the first to introduce that existing application to a new community in a new way.\n\n \n\n\nIn this way, the concept of cross-chain collaboration is not just at a foundational level; rather it will be driven by business and use cases that demand it.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBlockchaininBusiness.io will be that mechanism that streamlines the process for:\n\n \n\n\n\\* entrepreneurs to find viable projects with which to begin development\n\\* developers to determine how to connect to existing projects using authorized and verified linkages\n\n \n\n\nAs this is a Cardano based project that would be funded by Cardano, the visibility of Cardano related projects can be granted premium billing and, of course, the verification process will involve writing project resources to Cardano, regardless of the chain or decentralized ledger provenance of the project.\n\n \n\n\nThis provides Cardano with an innate strategic advantage and visibility.\n\n \n\n\nFrom an Africa and Emerging Economy Startup perspective, the BlockchaininBusiness.io platform will provide a one stop shop for developers, providers of capital, potential clients, and enthusiasts alike to research projects and perhaps make a determination to engage. This builds value for the developer and prospective investors.\n\n \n\n\nBlockchaininBusiness.io through its design will enable organizations in Africa that seek partners and collaborators to expand. Through our association with Wada, we are able to give a platform for native grown African projects to be \"listed\" along with international projects enabling them to be made visible to the broader Web3 community.\n\n \n\n\nThis project aligns with the Fund8 strategic goals in the following ways:\n\n \n\n\n\\* It helps people find projects in the Cardano and Cardano ecosystem to either use or contribute to\n\\* It helps expose Cardano projects beyond the Cardano community which will spur the development of cross-chain integration tools and API that will contribute to the Cardano project becoming more open-source.\n\\* It accelerates the growth and evolution of our developer & app ecosystem by inviting contributions from the rest of the blockchain space.\n\n \n\n\nKey Project Metrics:\n\n \n\n\nTo facilitate measurement, tools that record these metrics will be built into the platform as a form of cross-chain dashboard. Many of these metrics will involve self-reporting.\n\n \n\n\n\\* Number of Catalyst proposals including participants from other blockchain communities - will increase because if Cardano projects and other blockchain projects can find each other, they can turn to Catalyst to fund their integrations which can then be served as a model for others or develop into tools that can be used by other projects\n\\* Number of technical implementations connecting Cardano to other blockchains - will increase as the BlockchaininBusiness.io interface will be specifically designed to highlight ways in which projects can be integrated with\n\\* Ideas from other chains implemented by Catalyst - will increase since these project currently do not cross-talk in a systematic way with the Cardano community; having a single point of publicization will enable us to promote the existence of Catalyst to not only specific non-Cardano chains, but to a broad array of non-Cardano chains within one platform\n\\* Projects and dapps from other chains implemented on Cardano - this will be made possible because in listing these dapps and projects, the ability to be the first to create an interaction with the Cardano community provides a first to market opportunity to expose a non-Cardano project to the Cardano community; there is value in this\n\\* Catalyst-created solutions adopted by other chains/communities - the search and directory function enables developers to explore and determine those projects which are best suited for adoption\n\\* Number of events / workshops / sessions arranged with other communities - the BlockchaininBusiness.io platform will have an event section highlighting these cross-chain opportunities\n\\* Number of permanent initiatives with cross-chain teams (members from different blockchain communities together) - the platform will highlight multi-chain dapps and projects via filtered or faceted search\n"}', -- extra

In addition to many economic disadvantages, this (lack of development focused projects where blockchain is at the core) affects the acceptance and understanding of blockchain in less developed nations. This project will be an eye-opener for nations in Africa.\n\n \n\n\nBecause it will engage the public, the data source will be very wide while it will achieve the objective which is collecting and sharing data in a fast, cheap and in-depth approach. Because it uses AI and a blockchain-based ranking system, the collected data will be curated by quality.\n\n \n\n\nMarketing and communicating this product will be easier. First, this is a product for the public that gives ownership and empowerment feelings. Users, via comments and testimonials, can promote other users and the data. Since the product will create a community, it will promote its ecosystem on its own. We have already established how critical access to quality data in the current development effort of Africa is. This project can be promoted as the next big crowdsourced project in Africa, and it has the potential to become Africa''s Wikipedia.\n\n"}', -- extra

INTRA-AS traffic and INTER-AS traffic differ from those currently interconnected in Autonomous Systems (AS to blockchain). The sharding realm of a blockchain network can be autonomous for INTRA-Shard transactions. Thus, ''parallel writes'' can dramatically improve transaction processing speed. In addition, INTER-Shard transactions are processed by having Top-Level nodes operate the INTER-Shards chain. We plan to design a prototype system capable of processing 3,000 000 transactions per second over six months. If Cardano accepts the proposal, detailed designs will be completed by August 2022, and the Cardano system will be able to process 3,000 000 transactions per second as early as 2023."}', -- extra

Some CAs, vCAs have signs of using bots for their evaluation to maximize the benefit, negatively affecting genuine CAs & vCAs.\n\\* The number of projects realized and influenced by Cardano in the reality is limited.\n\n \n\n\nThe questions are: (1) How to get the attention of Ada holders and motivate them to vote for or against a proposal; (2) How to attract great proposers to proposed excellent projects for Cardano ecosystem; and (3) How to minimize the controversial issues originated from CAs, vCAs while maximizing their role as experts.

For the benefit of Cardano ecosystem, the two formers are the key players. Recommended proposals within this challenge should, therefore, focus their attention on building the governance mechanism of the Catalyst fund on Ada holders and proposers.\n\n \n\n\n- For ADA holders, when the reward is attractive, they will participate in voting for qualified proposals since such good proposals will bring value to Cardano ecosystem, or Ada holders themselves. For the selection of qualified proposals to vote for, naturally, Ada holders will utilize the participation of experts (CA, vCA) because this directly affects their interests.\u00a0In turn, CA and vCA will automatically doing their best to attract the selection of Ada holders. And, of course, Ada holders will be the one who pays for expert''s works (CA/vCA''s reviews). Cheating and/or poor review will soon die down, as a consequence.\n\n- For proposers, in order to receive votes from Ada holders, their project itself must be excellent and well approaches Ada holders. Proposers, therefore, will find the best way to introduce their proposals to the community in order to get funded and maximize their benefits.\u00a0It will in turn marketing Cardano to the community, naturally.\n\n \n\n\nProposal size:\n\nProposers'' need to think outside of the current Catalyst approach to create a breakthrough in Catalyst fund governance. A proposer team is welcome to propose a total solution for the governance of Catalyst fund mechanism both technical and in content with the whole fund of the challenge if the solution is presented in a clear and convincing manner.\n\n \n\n\nBudget rationale:\n\nTo be able to propose a Catalyst fund governance mechanism, the proposers'' team needs to include qualified personnel in governance, with professional knowledge and understanding of Catalyst funds. The team needs to brainstorm various options before getting to the optimal one to propose to the Catalyst. It is suggested that this governance mechanism should be verified by an independent and competent 3rd party.\n\n \n\n\nIn our opinion, this challenge should be voted for to absorb great Governance Mechanism as soon as possible for the beneficial of Ada holders themselves and for the development of Cardano ecosystem, in general.\n\n \n\n\nPlease VOTE for us.\n\n \n\n\nThank you.\n\n", "importance": "To attract talents to submit high-quality proposals and Ada holders to vote, an attractive governance of Catalyst Fund is a must.\n\n", "goal": "The number of high-quality proposal is increased.\n\nThe percentage of Ada participating in voting for/against project selection is increased.\n\n", "metrics": "When this challenge comes toward the end, we can ask ourselves:\n\n* The number of high-quality proposal is increased?\n* The number of Ada participating in voting for proposals increased?\n* Percentage of funded proposals over total submitted proposals increases?\n* The number of funded projects to be implemented in reality increases?\n* Talent around the world comes to Cardano ecosystem?\n* How is the feedback of the community about the Renovated Catalyst Governance?\n* Have the quality of the Cardano Ecosystem been increased?\n* Catalyst Fund becomes a pool of talent?\n* Signs of using bot for proposal review vanishes?\n* Controversial about proposal review vanishes?\n* Poor proposal reviews die down?\n"}', -- extra

    '{"solution": "Aedou is a Catalyst-funded, meaningful and inclusive play-to-earn game on the Cardano blockchain that has massive potential to adopt millions of gamers, students, teachers and researchers from outside the blockchain space. Through combining informal education with gaming, Aedou is enabling radically new ways of blockchain gaming and more sustainable business models & practices.\n\n \n\n\nOne unique opportunity is to become one of the first games that successfully combine playing with education. This has been tried by many with gamification or so-called \"serious games\", although the results are mostly standard educational approaches in disguise, resulting in a feeling of being cheated and thus being neither entertained nor educated. This is due to a lack of expertise in playing and a vast underestimation of the potential of games, belittling multiple genres with billions of users to only a \"waste of time\" and \"useless\". Aedou is designed by life-long gamers & learners that know what a true game needs to be a good game. All while having the nice benefit that you actually learn a new language and play cooperatively, not competitively, and get additional, undebatable value from playing a game while possibly spending hours inside of it.\n\nThere is NO real game yet that deals with learning languages. This is a huge chance to achieve mass adoption for Cardano and Atala PRISM (MineCraft & Roblox are trying to get into the formal education sector).\n\n \n\n\nMost gamers know that the NFT-craze and play-to-earn is receiving lots of hate and pushback from the global gaming community, and rightfully so. Cardano needs wholesome and meaningful games that include rather than exclude. This is why we do not press blockchain features onto people that just want to play and learn and do not want to get involved with blockchain in any way. All earning functionalities are optional and only activated once you become part of one of the DAOs of the game and thus decide to partake in the blockchain components of Aedou. We do not want to give players exclusive ownership of their assets and make them rich through speculation and greed. Our focus is to connect people from around the world to share, learn and communicate with each other while earning off of the game''s general revenue and helping each other grow. We want gamers to benefit as much as content creators while not raising any unneccesary barriers but to connect them more deeply and give gamers a say in the direction of Aedou''s future.\n\n \n\n\nAedou also has the potential to attract new users to the platform that do have no connection or even heavy biases against blockchain technology. This is why all blockchain components are optional, but easily within reach for every user to explore at their own leisure and only if they decide for the massive benefits.\n\n \n\n\nEvery part of Aedou will be made open source, so it will benefit all game developers on Cardano and related projects (e.g. treasury smart contract & very accessible level editor). Aedou will also run on distributed hosting & computing services (e.g. Arweave & NuNet).\n\n"}', -- extra

    '{"solution": "1. S-E-A-M - the Systemic Entrepreneurship Activity Method\n\n \n\n\nEntreprenerdy''s standard method is called SEAM, or Systemic Entrepreneurship Activity Method. This method was developed at the Norwegian University of Technology and Science (NTNU.no) in collaboration with several researchers in entrepreneurship and innovation from several European universities. The method is based on a comprehensive literature study and incorporates the leading modern theoretical directions in entrepreneurship. A particular focus is placed on the \u00absix pillars of entrepreneurship theory\u00bb (see attachment 1 S-E-A-M)\n\n \n\n\nThe method has been tested and improved since 2010 in collaboration with dozens of support programs and over 35,000 entrepreneurship projects worldwide. The method consists of 7 steps containing 29 elements that entrepreneurs will (and should) work through while establishing, developing, and improving their project. The seven steps are 1) Purpose 2) Resources 3) Business Idea 4) Business Model 5) Objectives 6) Tasks 7) Forecasting. These steps are further described in section 3 Program content and detail in \"Attachment 1 \u0096 S-E-A-M.\"\n\n \n\n\nTypically, entrepreneurs will work their way step by step through the steps of the method in several rounds. If they meet resistance, they will typically return to an earlier step and try to leverage the insights they have gained to make changes and improvements. Of course, following these steps to the tee is not the only way to succeed in an entrepreneurship project. At the same time, working methodically in this way will increase the probability of success. Then, of course, there is significant variation in the content of the seven steps over time and from project to project.\n\n \n\n\n1. Catalyst EMS - a unique Entrepreneurship Management System, based on S-E-A-M\n\n \n\n\nA common element in our deliveries to enable entrepreneurial support programs is the setup and adaptation of an Entrepreneurship Management System (EMS). The seven steps and 29 elements of S-E-A-M are distributed to the entrepreneurs via an online solution that is adapted and set up for the program. The EMS is made available to the participants from admission to the program and as long as they wish.\n\n \n\n\nCatalyst EMS will contain the following modules: 1) The program builder - for setting up the online session and their content, and for setting up a landing page, 2) The program finder (entyhub.com) \u0096 that will contribute to recruitment to the program, 3) Cohort management - where implementation of the sessions in the program is handled, 4) Business development - where the entrepreneurs are presented with the tools for e-learning and business development, 5) Collaboration - where all communication between the entrepreneurs in a cohort/in the program and between an entrepreneur and advisor is handled, and 6) Analysis and learning - with support for ongoing learning and improvement.\n\n \n\n\n1. Program content \u0096 12 sessions over four weeks, individual mentoring and monthly peer2peer network meetings\n\n \n\n\nWe propose a program that starts with four weeks of 12 online sessions, each lasting 90 minutes. In addition, there will be three individual mentoring sessions per participant, delivered by seasoned business advisors certified in the S-E-A-M and EMS. During the program, Cardano / catalyst community advisors will be trained in S-E-A-M to enable them to take on these individual mentoring sessions. Following the first four weeks, we suggest monthly peer2peer network meetings where the entire alumni network can join to help each other reach their objectives.\n\n \n\n\nThe 12 proposed sessions will be\n\n \n\n\nIntroduction \u0096 introduction to the program, to S-E-A-M and the EMS, and get to know each other\n\n \n\n\nPurpose \u0096 what are the reasons for becoming an entrepreneur?\n\n \n\n\nResources \u0096 What skills and assets will define the project?\n\n \n\n\nBusiness Idea \u0096 What problems are to be solved and for which target group?\n\n \n\n\nSustainability \u0096 understanding UN 17 SDGs and what sustainability means for your project.\n\n \n\n\nBusiness Model \u0096 how will the problems be solved, and how will revenue be generated?\n\n \n\n\nDesign Thinking, Minimum Viable Product and solution interview\n\n \n\n\nObjectives \u0096 What goals and milestones must be met to solve the problem?\n\n \n\n\nTasks \u0096 The activities that are to be completed to achieve the objectives.\n\n \n\n\nForecasting \u0096 What are the estimated revenues and expenses of the project\n\n \n\n\nPresentations - everyone gets to present their entire project, feedback and discussions on what''s next?\n\n \n\n\nBlockchain funding opportunities, investment landscape and high-level tokenomics \u0096 a program-specific session delivered by a Cardano community expert\n\n \n\n\nTo make the programs as valuable as possible for the individual entrepreneurs, we try to limit each cohort to 12 participating projects. The sessions are conducted over 90-120 minutes according to reverse classroom and project-based learning principles to ensure continuity and overview.\n\n \n\n\nEach session is divided into three parts: First, a \"roundtable\" is conducted (approx. 30 minutes). Each entrepreneur shares what has happened since the last session and specific learning points and challenges they have experienced working with the literature, video support and EMS. A facilitator then carries out a theory presentation that reviews and deepens the current topic (approx. 30 minutes). Here, great emphasis is placed on interaction and discussion. Finally, two of the participating projects are being presented (approx. 30 minutes), where the entrepreneurs get to present their projects and receive input and criticism from their co- entrepreneurs. The last few minutes inform the participants what to prepare for the next session.\n\n \n\n\nProject outcomes\n\n \n\n\nThe participants get:\n\n \n\n\n\\* to develop their projects step by step based on S-E-A-M\n\n \n\n\n\\* to present their project to advisors and the other participants\n\n \n\n\n\\* input, motivation, and inspiration from the other participants\n\n \n\n\n\\* to build a network that will help you reach your goals.\n\n \n\n\n\\* to define a roadmap for the further development of their project\n\n \n\n\n1. Certification in S-E-A-M and EMS of up to 10 community Advisors / Business Mentors\n\n \n\n\nOur proposal includes a certification program for up to 10 advisors selected by the Cardano community. The goal of the certification is to give the advisors a thorough insight into S-E-A-M (Systemic Entrepreneurship Activity Method) and how you as an advisor/mentor can use S-E-A-M together with related tools and educational methods to help deliver fantastic programs for entrepreneurs. Furthermore, during the whole project, we aim to enable the community to be self-sufficient with mentors skilled in S-E-A-M as a common method for developing entrepreneurship projects.\n\n \n\n\nThe consultants gain in-depth knowledge of modern entrepreneurship theories, S-E-A-M and the Entrepreneurship Management System during the certification. Furthermore, the advisers discuss how they can use the knowledge when providing mentoring sessions and guiding the entrepreneurs. The main goal is for the advisors to be even better equipped to enable the entrepreneurs to develop their projects and thereby create sustainable businesses/organizations. In addition, the certification will contribute to the establishment of a common method and entrepreneurship terminology across the Cardano community. From experience, this again provides a basis for further development of cooperation.\n\n \n\n\nHow is the certification carried out?\n\n \n\n\nThe theoretical part of the certification is done online with nine sessions of 90 minutes over three weeks. Like the Entrepreneurship Programs, the program is based on reverse classroom pedagogy and case-based learning. Between the sessions, the advisers get to work on their own \"project\" to get a first-hand experience of how this is for the contractors, and that you get to present and discuss the projects - and not least how they can best help the contractors.\n\n \n\n\nSuppose there are community advisers who also want to be certified as facilitators. In that case, it is required that they a) participate in a complete entrepreneurship program led by one of Entreprenerdy''s facilitators, but then in a hosting role where they are phased into how we lead the sessions - and b) that they lead an entire program of 12 sessions for entrepreneurs with one of Entreprenerdy''s experts present as co-pilot/supervisor.\n\n \n\n\n1. Program management services\n\n \n\n\nRecruitment and application\n\n \n\n\nWhen a program is defined, we assist our program partners in developing a communication plan. First, various links are distributed through advertising, direct mailings, the program finder and social media. These links lead to the program landing page, where the Entrepreneur is shown to the EMS''s application module. Here we have jointly set up the questions that the partner wants to be answered and all the possible cohorts for which there are vacancies. The Entrepreneur then goes through a simple chain of questions, where they define some metadata and their motivation and the core elements of the business idea they want to apply with. Finally, they use for participation in a specific cohort in the program.\n\n \n\n\nProgram management\n\n \n\n\nNow that we have a complete set-up of the cohort in the EMS that includes all the sessions with content, times, meeting places and eventual ZOOM/Teams links to each session, responsible facilitators and the accepted entrepreneurs, each Entrepreneur will receive a welcome pack. This package is distributed electronically and will contain all the slide sets for the program, the e-book, list of participants, agenda, and description of preparation for each session.\n\n \n\n\nThe facilitator will communicate to all participants through the EMS - and the Entrepreneur will be encouraged to post a presentation about himself in the collaboration room to start getting to know the other participants even before the program begins.\n\n \n\n\nWhen the program starts, the project presentations in each session are run from the EMS - and the facilitator uses the EMS to open the steps before each session, as well as to monitor the progress of each Entrepreneur, and ensure that the advisors/mentors follow up as agreed.\n\n \n\n\nAnalysis and learning\n\n \n\n\nThe EMS comprises millions of 56-character cards, making it possible to store fragmented information from the EMS without it is possible to reverse engineer this back to each business plan. This provides a unique opportunity to aggregate data that has been used to publish several scientific reports and findings from several universities. In addition, it enables a significant opportunity for learning within each program and for each project. Insight into how one''s model differs from other similar projects, how the relevant program activates the entrepreneurs, and how the consultants interact with the projects and the entrepreneurs will provide valuable reflection and learning for the individual. There will eventually be a lot of new functionality, which we develop based on the wishes of the entrepreneurs, program partners, advisors, and facilitators.\n\n"}', -- extra

This immutable and verifiable projects audit-trail will reinforce and assure confidence to ALL shakeholders/players that ultimately leads to lower cost of project funding. \n\n \n\n\nAfrican disaprora remittances (in-flows) that are geared towards building & construction projects will be funneled into this secure solution with tangible financial projects cost benefits. \n\n \n\n\nAtala PRISM Integration\n\n \n\n\nWe will utilize IOHK/EMURGO Atala PRISM solutions as the principle identification and authentication methodology for ALL stakeholders as below:\n\n \n\n\n1. Over 42 Financial Institutions to Fund Projects in Kenya. -\u00a0We will invite, verify, certify and register qualified financial institutions'' into the \\*marketplace to provide\\* \\*Retail /Individual customers''\\* \\*with competitive project funding offers\\*.\u00a0These approved financial institutions'' will be registered under Atala PRISM tailored solution. \\*All Smart Contract payments and receipts to/from project stakeholders\u0092 (Products Suppliers & Professional Service providers\u0092 etc), will utilize our tailored designed Atala PRISM identification and authentication system solution.\\*\n2. Register over 200,000 Retail Customers\u0092 in Kenya per annum -\u00a0We will utilize Atala PRISM intergation solution as the primary mode to \\*register an estimate 200,000 retail customers\u0092 in the marketplace per annum in Kenya\\*. This will give retail customers'' power to \\*control access of their data\\* in the ecosystem. According to the Africa Development Bank\u0092s, Housing Market Dynamics in Africa 2018 (El-hadj M. Bah et al) the housing deficit in Africa stands at over 51 million units (potential to register over 51 million individual house/home owners'')\n3. African and Foreign Manufacturers\u0092 and Wholesalers\u0092/Retailer Shops\u0092 -\u00a0We will register ALL business entities under Atala PRISM to \\*ensure data (Bios'' & Transactions) integrity and confidentiality\\* at every stage of business relationship continuum. \\*All payments and receipts within the closed supply-chain ecosystem; along with receipts from project funders (financial institutions) will be linked via Atala PRISM under Smart Contract.\\*\n4. Potential to register 54 National Governments'' Taxes deductions and remittance value-chain on Cardano blockchain. -\u00a0All proposed \\*national and county governments taxes (excise duty, VAT, import duties taxes, local licenses, sales taxes etc.)\\* \\*deductions, collection and remittance\\* \\*in the marketplace will utilize Atala PRISM tailored solution.\\*\u00a0We will on-board these national government agencies in Phase 2 of the project to accomplish this objective.\n5. Registration of Professional Service Providers (Architects, Building Engineers etc).-\u00a0We will utilize Atala PRISM as the primary registration solution for ALL professional service providers within the \\*marketplace in Kenya and beyond\\* as identified below;\n\n \n\n\n\\* \\*Registered Architects in Kenya....................1,556.\\*\n\\* \\*Quantity Surveyors -in Kenya........................820.\\*\n\\* \\*Civil & Structural Engineers in Kenya..........1,458.\\*\n\\* \\*Electrical Engineers in Kenya........................436.\\*\n\\* \\*Mechanical Engineers in Kenya.....................374.\\*\n\\* \\*Kenya Building Contractors over..............18,000.\\*\n\n Sub- total ................................................22,644\n\n \n\n\nWe will further provide the respective professional bodies with Cardano blockchain value-addition services as below;\n\n \n\n\n\\* \\*Active members\u0092 registration database.\\*\n\\* \\*Collection of professional services annual subscription fees and any other monetary\u00a0transactions in \u0093FIAT\u0094 or \u0093Cryptocurrencies\u0092\u0094.\\*\n\n \n\n\nELIMINATION OF DUAL POINT-OF-FAILURE IN COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS & PROJECT PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT/FRAUD.\n\n \n\n\nOther major\u00a0negative consequence of using illicit/counterfeit products in building and construction is the high risk of collapse of properties (loss of investment), asset distraction by fire, loss of life or injuries and unwarranted hospitalization.\n\n \n\n\nKenya has witnessed numerous properties collapse,\u00a0as shown by the YouTube video-clips below;\n\n \n\n\n\\* \\*https://youtu.be/2JSPBBMzHnc - Five Storey Building Collapses in Kenya on 5th March 2022.\\*\n\\* https://youtu.be/IyTX4E\\\\_ly2Y - Scores injured after a nine storey building collapses in Ruiru on 17th October 2021.\n\\* https://youtu.be/Z9XYt58jatA - Live footage of a 5 storey building collapse in Kenya in August 2016.\\\\*\\\\*\n\n \n\n\nIn Phase 2, we will develop a Cardano land registry interface between financial institutions and governments'' land registry for all parcels of land purchased in our marketplace to build houses/homes.\n\n"}', -- extra

    '{"solution": "\\*a) Problem:\\*\n\n\\* Some CAs evaluate proposals where they do not have project-related expertise with the purpose of having as many reviews as possible for a higher reward. CA evaluates the proposals under the MECHANISM that he/she can either receive or not receive reward (win only) and there is no penalty (no loose) for doing negative affection for Cardano''s development. This leads to the existence of poor quality reviews, no good suggestions for the proposers to adjust, no good advice for the Ada holders to vote for or against the proposals.\n\\* For financial purposes, a few CAs use bots to evaluate projects, resulting in poor quality reviews for both proposers and voters.\n\\* The main cause of these problems is that the interests of the CA have not been directly attached to the interests of the proposers and/or the voters.\n\n \n\n\n\\*b) Proposed solution:\\*\n\nAny succeeded financial game needs two faces: (1) Rewards; and (2) Penalties; for serious players to participate. The proposed solution here is developed to have both Reward and Punishment mechanism for CA to attract talented and interested professionals to participate. The mechanism includes 3 major factors:\n\n\\* The expertise of the CA versus the main expertise of the project.\n\\* Signs of using bot for evaluation. And\n\\* The reward/penalty mechanism that is proportional to the quality (contribution to the project owner, to the voter) of the review.\n\n \n\n\n\\*c) Technical solution:\\*\n\nParallel to building CA audit tools and plugins. We will be creating a database of CAs and vCAs for many years to come. In addition to the official update from Catalyst through Funds, in the long term, we want to analyze this data source on the basis of bigDATA with simulation algorithms. This will in the future help create a reference source for Cardano''s DAO formation and governance.\n\n \n\n\n\\* Build APIs pool.\n\\* Architecting and building the original database.\n\\* Realization of statistics on the web.\n\\* Functions to review and classify CAs according to established criteria.\n\\* The virtual reward model in the system is almost similar to Catalyst''s current reward mechanisms.\n\\* Essential statistics and indicators for Ideascale.\n\n \n\n\nWith the vision of the project towards a testing system for the CA process as well as implementing prototypes before the next funding rounds of Catalyst Funding.\n\n \n\n\n\\*The programming languages and tools we used to develop this project include:\\*\n\n\\* NodeJS, React, Flutter, JavaScript, MySQL, MongoDB,\n\\* Operating system used: Linux, iOS, Android...\n\\* Infrastructure like Amazon Services cloud computing, Softlayer of IBM\n"}', -- extra

NuNet''s proposal will enable tapping into that huge potential market (e.g. ETH miners) and linking to the demand in the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n \n\n\nNuNet, a spinoff of SingularityNet, allows to run arbitrary computing workflows on community provisioned hardware and provides payment gateways directly from software or application via Cardano Plutus Smart Contracts. Adding the functionality to source decentralized GPU computing resources via NuNet ecosystem will tap into a huge and expanding part of global computing infrastructure, powering growing industries of AI as well as the emerging industry of Metaverse. NuNet\u0092s ability to connect decentralized hardware into a single workflow is an attractive possibility for these industries.\n\n \n\n\nThis would greatly increase the possibilities of the growing ecosystem on Cardano as already witnessed by the needs of DeepchainAda: Trustless AI training.

For the purpose of this proposal, tech repairers are entrepreneurs in the informal market of Ghana whose specialties include repairing broken devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, and tech devices. The identity would help easy identification of tech repairers for individuals with broken devices to connect for their services. The DApp would be created using Plutus and the interaction between tech repairers and device owners would be via smart contract. The smart contract would have the main function to show proof of service, transparent cost, and distribution of incentives. The on-chain solution aims at providing a cost-effective and quality P2P ecosystem by identifying tech repairers and connecting them to devices users. This would provide incentive and generally increase the income level of informal sector workers like tech repairers, hence reducing poverty.\n\nThe information will enable the platform to assign an efficiency rating tag to each tech repairer onboarded onto the DApp. The DApp would also be designed to provide users the details of the cost of repairing a broken device. The platform would engage tech repairers to set a fair price by using information about the state of a faulty smart device, device brand, and other device information. The Dapp platform would also offer a unique services that affords customers the comfort of having their phones picked up for repair.\n\n"}', -- extra

    '{"solution": "First, I would like to explain a little about Gabon. It is a small country in Central Africa with a population of about 2 million. The forest just below the equator grows the richest and most diverse flora and fauna on the planet, occupying 87% of the country''s land area. The climate is characterized by high temperature and humidity almost all the time, and there are only two seasons, the rainy season and the dry season. In our project, we will cultivate a tropical plant of the leguminous family called Indigofera, which contains the largest amount of a raw material for dyes, and Gabon\u0092s such climate is perfect for Indigofera to grow. And since the population of Gabon is small and the population density is very low (8 people per square meter) for a large land area, it can be said that there is no inconvenience in space. So the hurdles for acquiring farmland are low, which is convenient for our project.\n\n \n\n\nGabon is a country rich in natural resources such as precious timber, oil and manganese, and its GDP per capita is about the same as that of Eastern European countries. However, due to lack of fairness in income distribution, the disparity is large, strong industries are not growing, and the economy is not diversifying, so most of the people are forced to live in poverty and the unemployment rate is very high. There is still a lot of room for Gabon to develop in the future.\n\n \n\n\nThe use of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in Gabon is new, with a relatively low percentage of banking (30%), although higher than the African average (10%).\u00a0It is an almost untouched country in Africa, which CARDANO / ADA attaches great importance to, and it may be possible to win the first-mover advantage in the wake of this project.\n\n \n\n\nNow let\u0092s get into the main subject. What we propose is a mechanism for sustainable fashion starting from Gabon, which is supported by blockchain technology. Information related to the cultivation of indigo plants, and various information related to the act of dyeing can be guaranteed by blockchain, which has excellent traceability and tamper resistance innately. As a result, the value of the clothing we manufacture as sustainable fashion is guaranteed, and the difference from fast fashion led by large companies, which is one of the causes of global warming, is clearer to consumers. Currently, petroleum derived dyes are used in almost all fashion items on the market, regardless of the type of material, from organic cotton to high-tech synthetic fibers, but those who are aware of this is still limited.\u00a0In this era of increasing environmental awareness, however, we believe it''s only a matter of time before people realize that all the colors used in their fashion are unsustainable. If that happens, we predict that the social needs for sustainable dye production will increase at a stretch.\n\n \n\n\nGrow plants, extract dyes, dye clothes, wear them, and when they fade, dye them again and reuse them -\u00a0such cycle of production and reuse, which is commonplace for natural indigo, seems to hide hints for future fashion. Furthermore, by utilizing the tamper resistance and traceability of blockchain, we will create a mechanism to directly convey the origin of all raw materials including dyes and all manufacturing processes up to commercialization to end users. When this becomes a reality, the dynamism of traditional mass-produced and consumer fashion with unknown roots will be renewed.\n\n"}', -- extra

Furthermore, the solution will enable smallholder farmers to easier access financing, agronomic advisory and build their credit profile. Furthermore, with nearly 80% of households in Tanzania engaging in agriculture and at least one third gaining more than half of their income from agricultural activities, access to finance for small-scale producers is a major catalyst to broad based economic growth. \n\n \n\n\nFor a long time and especially in traditional forms of financing, one of the key limiting factors for access to loans for smallholder farmers has been lack of collateral. Looking at land ownership registration for instance, data collected by Tanzania\u0092s bureau of statistics in 2018 shows that out of 8.7 million farms surveyed only 18% were registered. \n\n \n\n\nThe current problem is the lack of historical and in-season data to assess credit risk on smallholder farmers, this due to a lack of infrastructure consisting of agricultural land classification, crop classification, long-term productivity assessment (20-30+ years) on the individual farm-land and field boundaries. \n\n \n\n\nCurrently, field boundaries are manually created by field agents walking the corners of a physical agricultural field and geo-tagging those boundaries, this is time-consuming, expensive and often inaccurate.

Whether the underlying medical condition is impaired sight, impaired motor function, or some other condition, many individuals with disabilities find it difficult to design and implement online systems that are optimally accessible for individuals having a wide range of medical conditions giving rise to one or another form of disability. We plan to address this problem in our own work and, in doing so, to document the solutions that seem to particularly germane to the use of the Atala Prism ID system and Cardano dApps.

    '{"brief": "It is not enough for Catalyst to attract and retain one type of people. Diverse talent with its multitude of viewpoints leads to better innovation. Creating a more inclusive community will lead to a diversity of ideas and thoughts as well as a better sense of belonging. An innovation platform cannot afford to be homogeneous. If we want inclusive culture and a richer perspective, we have to listen to those who are different from the majority.\n\n \n\n\nTo an outsider, Catalyst is a blur. To a newcomer, it can be confusing. To those who stay, it''s still confusing. How might we make Catalyst a safe and welcoming place for all kinds of people?\n\n \n\n\nIn the world of business, there\u0092s a saying \u0091Great employee experience leads to great customer experience\u0092. More than just financial rewards, people long for a sense of mastery, autonomy and purpose (see e.g. Daniel Pink: \"Drive\").\n\n \n\n\n\"People who see the world differently and have diverse ideas and perspectives often bring creativity and innovation to an organization. But because of their outsider status, they may struggle to have their ideas recognized by colleagues as legitimate.\" (Harvard Business Review: \"The New Analytics of Culture\")\n\n \n\n\nGreat culture is good for successful recruitment and retention of diverse talent. If people don\u0092t feel included, trusted and heard, they will either leave or remain lurkers forever. Culture needs to be built into the core of the organization and it needs to be nurtured over time via initiatives that encourage constructive sharing of ideas.\n\n \n\n\nThere are many lenses, or paradigms, through which one can view diversity:\n\n \n\n\nResistance: Demand for diversity, coming from outside of the monocultural core group, is viewed as a threat to the perceived unity or a \u0091non-issue\u0092, something that is not important enough to even discuss. People feel safer working with similar colleagues so any attempts to increase diversity are stifled.\n\n \n\n\nNon-discrimination: Also referred to as \u0091Color-Blindness\u0092 or meritocracy, this paradigm focuses on equal employment opportunities but without acknowledging potential differences due to different backgrounds. The thinking goes: \u0093People should be treated equally no matter where they are from; cultural background does not count and does not need to be specifically dealt with.\u0094 Thinking \u0091we are all the same\u0092 aims to assimilate and hide diversity; important differences are not valued.\n\n \n\n\nFairness: In this paradigm, diversity is seen as a matter of equal opportunity and fair treatment. An organization addresses the need for specific support for minority groups, reducing social inequalities. While the concern for fairness is genuine, this is good for the organization\u0092s image and helps recruitment, while guaranteeing compliance with legal and social requirements. People operating from this standpoint may have good intentions but fall short in truly utilizing diversity for the organization\u0092s and its members'' full benefit. Preserving harmony may stifle creative dissent.\n\n \n\n\nAccess and legitimacy: In this paradigm, differences are celebrated but only because they make business sense. The thinking goes that for the organization to be relevant, it needs to portray the same diversity as the global society it operates in. The danger of this approach is that monoculture remains the norm and \u0094the diverse\u0094 are kept on the sidelines. People may feel exploited if they find out that they are there just to make the organization look diverse.\n\n \n\n\nLearning and growth: This final paradigm also promotes equal opportunity, acknowledges differences and values them but it doesn\u0092t assimilate everyone into one mold or form silos and pockets of diversity. Instead, it connects people with diverse traits, backgrounds, knowledge and skills. Listening is encouraged and differences are internalized so that the organization can learn and grow because of them.\n\n \n\n\nThe benefits of adopting the learning and growth paradigm are clear:\n\n \n\n\n\\* It brings new ideas and different knowledge for everyone\u0092s use.\n\\* It helps us to develop new skills and approaches to the work we do.\n\\* It helps us become more innovative as individuals, as teams and as a whole organization.\n\n \n\n\nWhen culture of inclusion becomes a collective strength, it helps align strategies with people\u0092s diverse capabilities. However, it takes time and needs to be enabled through a consciously built culture that encourages trust and belonging.\n\n \n\n\nIn this kind of culture, everyone feels at ease, no matter how heated the daily discussions get. In a truly effective innovation platform, it is not only okay to voice out differing opinions; it is expected.\n\n \n\n\nAn ideal Catalyst Culture:\n\n \n\n\n\\* Is fun, relaxed and welcoming.\n\\* Communicates that diversity of background, opinion and insight are essential.\n\\* Creates an expectation of high standards of performance from everyone.\n\\* Stimulates personal development and emotional intelligence.\n\\* Promotes peer mentoring and learning from one another.\n\\* Encourages openness, trust, asking, listening and a sense of belonging.\n\\* Makes people feel heard, respected and valued.\n\\* Breathes life into a well-articulated and widely understood mission.\n\\* Supports and maintains an egalitarian and non-bureaucratic structure.\n\\* Allows a degree of creative friction for innovation to flourish.\n\n \n\n\nExamples of proposals you could submit to this challenge:\n\n\\* Educational events to explore the related concepts and research\n\\* Discussion fora to help us understand each other and to work better together\n\\* Use of software to make meeting culture more inclusive (e.g. Otter & Equalicert)\n\\* Analysis tools to understand how culture influences Catalyst members'' thoughts and behaviour.\n\\* Social media content creation to help raise awareness\n\\* Tools that help in recruitment and onboarding of top talent\n\\* Incentives for bringing different types of people together in teams\n\\* Surveys, interviews and documentation of \"the Catalyst pulse\"\n\\* Systems and processes that strengthen inclusiveness in Catalyst\n\\* Partnerships with external expert organizations\n\\* Initiatives to clarify our shared mission, vision, values and goals\n\\* Competence development tools and frameworks\n\\* Mentoring, coaching and peer support structures and solutions\n\\* Wellbeing and community listening related initiatives\n\\* Celebrations, rites, rituals and other cultural artefacts to strengthen the culture\n\\* Leadership development initiatives\n\\* Equal participation and engagement initiatives\n\n \n\n\nIt is up to all of us to propose initiatives that help strengthen the most important asset Cardano has: the community.

We\u0092re looking for a CARDANO-Developer Community Leader to lead the cross-chain collaboration with Andrzej and Rafael, and jointly introduce it to the two DESO-Developer Communities we\u0092re part of: DesoLabs (https://diamondapp.com/u/DeSoLabs) and Love4Src (https://diamondapp.com/u/love4src); and the same for the CARDANO Dev. Communities our new team member considers more appropriate. This cross-chain team will share eachother the respective repositories.\n5. If the F8 fund is granted to us, this cross-chain initiative will be made public by. and the set of tools and templates we built will become available to both dev. communities, on a standard and clear manner.\n6. We don\u0092t only aim to consider dev. related activity on this cross-chain initiative, but also entrepreneurial and collaborative. For example, by presenting to DESO Community the general dynamics of Catalyst Ecosystem, such as challenge set-up and the role of CAs, VCAs and Voting.\n7.

    '{"brief": "This is a challenge that helps Projects on their mission to demonstrate that Cardano can allocate resources aligned with a specific interest or greater good which has been neglected by the traditional System for decades now. The best way to fight greenhouse gasses is by reducing energy-consumption. But this is not enough, we need to make the Cardano ecosystem Climate Positive; if achieved, the World will be a more regenerative, better place. We should incentivize that with at least a small % of our collective Potential.\n\n \n\n\nWhat began as a challenge, has turned into a community: Cardano4Climate\n\n \n\n\nWhile holding weekly meetups for 6 month now we have engaged with many different proposers and projects. Last funding round as a community, we have identified [1]many proposals already that were closely related to this challenge and we invited many more to the [2]sustainability event that we hold continuously now.\n\n \n\n\nWhen talking about the fundamentals of Climate Change itself we would like to encourage you to read up on the papers and the official reports. We specifically refer to the [3]IPCC reports (we also linked a shorter and easier to read press-release in the links section):\n\n \n\n\n\"GENEVA, Aug 9 \u0096 Scientists are observing changes in the Earth''s climate in every region and across the whole climate system, according to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report, released today. Many of the changes observed in the climate are unprecedented in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years, and some of the changes already set in motion\u0097such as continued sea level rise\u0097are irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years.\"\n\n \n\n\n\"The report projects that in the coming decades climate changes will increase in all regions. For 1.5\u00b0C of global warming, there will be increasing heat waves, longer warm seasons and shorter cold seasons. At 2\u00b0C of global warming, heat extremes would more often reach critical tolerance thresholds for agriculture and health, the report shows.\"\n\n \n\n\n\"Stabilizing the climate will require strong, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and reaching net zero CO2 emissions. Limiting other greenhouse gasses and air pollutants, especially methane, could have benefits both for health and the climate\"\n\n \n\n\nHow will this challenge provide a springboard for Cardano adoption?\n\n \n\n\nThe green-movement is bigger than ever and companies like Tesla are immensely popular and successful not because they make cars that accelerate faster, but because their electric and therefore environmentally friendly cars are clearly one very important piece of the puzzle when it comes to preventing climate change. If we had to take a \\*wild guess\\* as to what one of the other pieces of the puzzle could be, we would propose looking into better governance systems for example. By having experiments on the topic of climate change, not only will Catalyst contribute to preventing climate change but also position Cardano as the green blockchain of the future and hopefully Catalyst will learn about how to deal with such urgent and tough problems.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHow will this challenge advance Cardano''s mission?\n\n \n\n\nIf we can''t build Systems that are better than our traditional Systems, what are we doing here? We could go back to central banks and governing classes. How to better prove that Cardano is a worthwhile endeavor to the young, the governments, the people than by showing our commitment and contribution to the environment.\n\n \n\n\nGuiding questions\n\n \n\n\nWhat will have the greatest impact on climate change in the short and long term?\n\n \n\n\nWhat real-world regenerative solutions already exist that would benefit from applications developed on the Cardano blockchain now, and in the near future?\n\n \n\n\nHow can we incentivize individuals, local communities, councils and municipal authorities, businesses and governments to prioritize taking action to reduce our overall greenhouse gas footprint?\n\n \n\n\nWhat are the most useful and scalable applications to put Cardano at the forefront of real, actionable solutions which reduce the greenhouse gasses we will pass on to future generations?\n\n \n\n\nHow can we minimize Cardano''s greenhouse gasses further or even become Climate positive?\n\n \n\n\nProposal success metrics:\n\n \n\n\nHow big is the impact on Cardano''s self-sustainability?\n\n \n\n\nHow big is the impact on greenhouse gasses (Co2, \u0085)?\n\n \n\n\nHow big is the impact on regenerating our planet?\n\n \n\n\nHow big is the awareness that will be created?\n\n \n\n\nIs your proposal financially sustainable after funding?\n\n \n\n\nBudget rationale\n\n \n\n\nObviously this is not a Climate Fund, but having a small percentage being used for exploration on how Cardano can help solve this wicket problem is really the minimum we can do given the urgency of the issue now and the long time it took for it to finally be recognized by the mainstream.\n\n \n\n\nLinks\n\n \n\n\nJoin our Community!\n\n \n\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/Cardano4Climate\n\n \n\n\nPress release on IPCC-report:\n\n \n\n\nhttps://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr/\n\n \n\n\nhttps://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/climate-change/\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nReferences\n\n \n\n\n[1] https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w89O\\\\_6R-sqd9WmCTttdaUtwAenckJlZt1nJT2LmatQY/edit#gid=0\n\n \n\n\n[2] https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Cardano-Catalyst-Community-Network/events/jqqjqsyccqbtb\n\n \n\n\n[3] https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n", "importance": "Legacy systems have failed us on climate change!

    '{"solution": "Defending against government attacks, compromising legislation and unfair tax policies involves a constant commitment to the dissemination of adapted and focused knowledge to positively influence decision-makers in the political sphere.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe proposal aims to create a ThinkTank that in this challenge will deliver a \u0093toolkit\u0094. The ThinkTank is useful in the political sphere characterized as an agent of change that carries out information transfer, aggregating and presenting knowledge through collaboration with various public and private actors.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhile policymakers may not have the tools to respond quickly to a critical policy issue, they often suffer, not just from a lack of information, but also from an \u0093avalanche\u0094 of unstructured information that ends up negatively interfering with decision making. Overcoming these obstacles often requires knowing where to turn to rigorous, reliable, and accessible information and analysis.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith the aim of channeling a trusted source on blockchain to public policymakers, we will create \u0093ThinkTank\u0094 and its first product linked to this challenge: \u0093toolkit\u0094 on blockchain for legislators (let''s think about whether to focus on legislators or leave a broader term like \u0093takers of political decisions\u0094).\n\n\u00a0\n\nA \u0093toolkit\u0094 is conceived as a comprehensive set of recommendations for shaping or reforming policies that are based on insights gained from research. In other words, its main objective is to inform policymakers about the main parameters that need to be considered for specific policy decisions relevant to a given issue, in the case of blockchain. The \u0093toolkits\u0094 establish existing evidence that is relevant, present potential solutions, address their applicability and assess their long-term impact.\n\n \n\n\nThere are several types of \u0093toolkits\u0094 and we should focus on presenting basic concepts and best practices about blockchain and the Cardano ecosystem. The most basic analytical tool is the identification of good practices. \u0093Best practice\u0094 status is achieved on the basis of a positive evaluation of an initiative, typically through expert opinion. It is the simplest analytical tool, but possibly also the most powerful. It emphasizes the virtues of cases that have achieved good results, highlighting the defining elements or characteristics that are held responsible for their outstanding performance. Identification is generally based on predominantly qualitative analyzes that employ interpretive research methods involving a case-oriented and context-sensitive perspective. We must remember that despite being a survey, it must have simple and objective language.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere should be an event to launch the toolkit at the National Congress with the aim of directly reaching decision-makers, initiating the education and influence process. Publicity in the press and social networks is also an important procedure in the logic of political influence and should be considered to ensure the greatest impact of the proposed action.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMaria Carmo''s participation as the person to represent ThinkTank will have a very positive impact in terms of leadership and influence due to her history in the Cardano community, being Brazilian. History, local identification and credibility are essential elements for the success of the \u0093campaign\u0094. Allied to her experience was Daniela Andrade with more than 10 years of experience in advocacy actions in Bras\u00edlia.\n\n"}', -- extra

    '{"solution": "According to Google\u0092s Project Aristotle, the two primary behavioral norms associated with the most successful teams are:\n\n \n\n\n1. The ability of all members of the team to practice turn-taking, in other words, the ability to share and hear many ideas without judgment and evaluation.\n2. A high level of social-intuiting, meaning\u00a0an ability to assess others\u0092 emotional states via nonverbal cues.\n\n \n\n\nWhen these 2 norms are in place, a team is actively building an environment of psychological safety, which Google\u0092s study proved is directly correlated to increasing a team\u0092s collective intelligence. On the flipside, when these two norms are not present, the group\u0092s collective intelligence is diminished.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nAddressing Norm 1 & 2\u00a0\n\nRestorative Practices (RP) explicitly teach applicable skills and frameworks for inviting equal voice and active listening. RP create spaces for generating new ideas and sharing perspectives, with agreements in place that prevent the cross-talk and judgment that create unsafe environments. In this way, RP foster generative discussions with a spirit of \u0093\\*yes, and\\*\u0094 in place of \u0093\\*either / or\\*.\u0094 All participants\u0092 ideas and suggestions are valued.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nIn order to nurture an inclusive environment within a global community, Cardano \\*must\\* deliberately incorporate methods for overcoming cultural differences in order to connect authentically and be mindful about language- verbal and nonverbal- that may inadvertently cause harm. Setting aside intentional time for building relationships is the first step in improving social intuiting skills. Within that time, RP are used as methods for engagement that surfaces how team members are feeling, and what their present needs are. Restorative tools allow for this social connection time to be efficient and productive in accomplishing psychological safety norms 1 and 2. The investment of \\*some\\* time in these practices proactively enables teams to avoid loss of \\*exponential\\* amounts of time when teams react to harm by devolving into complaining, commiserating, and drama.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nCollaboration, expressing diverse ideas, innovation and a defined conflict resolution process are key first principles to the success of Cardano and need to be cultivated, tracked & measured.\u00a0Oftentimes companies or projects copy & paste what others have done to spur innovation, yet this only works if unique leaders are present.\u00a0Instead, by educating the Cardano Community on the Collaboration - Conflict Continuum, and training champions who help track, measure & analyze this, Cardano provides an environment of High Support - High Control to ensure the Community around the world contributes to a \u0093working \\*WITH\\*\u0094\u00a0environment [\\*See the \"Doing With\" quadrant in the graphic below.]\\* This aligns the social capital of the community with the high innovation needed to be an industry leader!\u00a0\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nThe Social Capital Window of Restorative Practices\n\n \n\n\nDiversity is crucial to invite various experiences, backgrounds, education levels, and ways of thinking (Chin et al., 2016; Giles, 2018; Grant, 2018; Hooker & Csikszentmihalyi, 2003; Hoskisson et al., 2016; Sawyer, 2017). For innovation to thrive, instilling a clear value to honor and encourage diverse thinking is necessary. This is why, for example, simply hiring women and minorities falls short despite good intentions to increase diversity. Research has shown that in mixed-gendered working groups, men are more likely to interrupt, exerting dominance in conversation (Karakowsky & Miller, 2004). Research concludes that workplaces still reflect Eurocentric norms that cause bias and, further, that those biases are ignored if colleagues prioritize group harmony over any other factors (Opie & Roberts, 2017). Supporting true inclusion by encouraging the expression and reception of different voices, ideas, and perspectives may include constructive conflict, which can be challenging to any workplace but especially a workplace that has discouraged dealing with conflict. Inclusive initiatives must be structured and practiced before their value can be appreciated for the wealth of new information and opportunities it can bring to a workplace.\n\n \n\n\nAddressing Financial Impact: Loss of employees/team members from a project is costly\u00a0\n\n\\* It costs a company approximately 33% of one employee\u0092s annual salary to replace them.\n\\* Departure of valuable team members from a given project can lead not just to a loss of money and energy invested, but also harm to the team\u0092s overall goals and product.\n\n \n\n\nThrough implementation of RP, teams are encouraged to address conflict when it is still minor. Anyone who has been employed at a workplace has either witnessed or been involved in a dynamic where people imagine they are \u0093letting go\u0094 of the minor stuff, when in reality, the small problems begin to accumulate and agitate under the surface, gradually growing into big problems, leading to blow-up fights, long-term resentment, and irreparable grudges.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nTeams who participate in RP training will learn to practice Conflict Transformation through use of the Restorative Conversation tool. This tool builds agency between parties who have caused harm and been harmed to come together to grow through new understanding and perspectives. By communicating through the conflict, they gain a new lens that lifts them out of tunnel vision, allowing them to discover new and unforeseen solutions. The process challenges and disarms assumptions and biases. Conflict will likely always be uncomfortable, but when teams have a map in place that guides them through a difficult conversation, they will generate new ideas that will both heal relationships and foster innovation in the process. The repaired relationship strengthens the team\u0092s capacity to work well together, and the experience of conflict transformation will organically impact their ability to generate new ideas while addressing differences respectfully.\n\n"}', -- extra

We are exploring ways of doing this, including the possibility of minting native tokens backed by an amount of ADA that would be staked or unstaked depending on the activity of these native tokens.

By providing the primitives marketplaces need to perform trades directly and securely on Erdstall, we eliminate the need for marketplace deposits, keeping our users\u0092 funds safe at every moment. Once funds are deposited in Erdstall, they can instantly be used on any marketplace or other service running on Erdstall. Competing marketplaces lead to low trading fees, encouraging high trading volumes and arbitrage, keeping prices accurate.\n\n \n\n\nMoreover, Erdstall is also perfect for managing game FTs and NFTs: the instant, cheap minting, transferring, and burning of NFTs allows games to manage all their items and currencies on Erdstall. Decentralized game developers can even integrate third-party Erdstall exchanges directly into their games.

By being fully open-source, we bring transparency and trust in how the service is delivered, demonstrating that the raw on-chain data isn''t tempered with for instance.\n2. By being fully open-source (across our whole stack: API infrastructure provisioning, API management, API definition and implementation), we allow others to fork our code and accelerate their own development thus reducing greatly their time to market. We accelerate overall the business value creation on Cardano and we make it accessible to all.\n\\* A Software As A Service Business Intelligence API:\n\\* Benefits:\n1. For those who simply want to consume Cardano on-chain data and our value added data analytics, we offer even greater time to market compression by providing a readily consumable SaaS service. People will be able to pay for that service in ADA, EUR, GBP, USD or by delegating to one of our sponsor SPOs.\n2. By creating new value added data insights, we target several customer segments (Investors, SPO, data aggregators, data analytics firms) and simplify their access to the Cardano on-chain data and insights. In doing so we enable new data-driven services inside and outside the Cardano ecosystem.\n\\* A series of reusable components:\n\\* Benefits:\n1. CLI backend tools will enable developers to streamline the creation of new event-driven workflows: e.g. interact with their end-customers when a specific event occurred on the blockchain, or when a specific metric reaches a specific value, or when an epoch ends for instance.\n2.

Most of the things that can be bought and sold will have to come from actually playing and progressing the game.

Find caches and try to extract their loot. Collect materials for crafting, map fragments for treasure hunts, keys for high tier chests and above all the valuable Geo Corp. credits. If you are wealthy enough you can buy zones in the virtual dimension to mark your territory and collect tax from other Geo Scavengers.\n\nUpgrade your gear by crafting new modules using the parts you will find in the caches scattered around the world.\n\nLevel up your tech skills to be a more efficient and competent scavenger, hone your diplomatic skills to reap benefits with Geo Corp and study mechanics and electronics to become a better crafter.\n\nThe unseen virtual layer enclosing our entire world is lousy with caches full of loot. The more desirable loot often have locks or puzzles you need to circumvent but the most valuable loot of them all are the ancient artifacts. To find artifacts you have to collect map fragment and use your crafting station to get a complete map.\n\nBuy zones to mark your territory and to collect tax from other players. The smart Geo Scavenger will figure out which zones are the most desirable and build a profitable strategy to maximize income.\n\nCraft keys to access loot in high tier locked caches. Craft gear upgrades to improve your scanners and loot finder. Refine materials into more valuable and usable materials.

    '{"solution": "As all aspects of NFTs, this is also very new in practice, so we\u0092re curious to explore this topic more with the community. There are many areas we could explore.\n\n \n\n\nPrimarily we want to focus on ways we can evolve and progress the discussion around the current CIP, and also figure out if there\u0092s a way that a royalty distribution and recognition standard can be merged with the undergoing initiative of building an on-chain verification tool as mentioned above.\n\n \n\n\nBut, there are many more areas we could explore.\n\nFor instance, one approach we could consider is:\n\n \n\n\nApply the royalty percentage only on profits from resales, not the entire amount.\n\n \n\n\nMost project creators probably don\u0092t expect a percentage from someone who supported their work initially, but is now selling for less, for example.\n\n \n\n\nMarketplace revenue from fees is not affected.\n\n \n\n\nThere are a number of reasons this could prove a good strategy:\n\n \n\n\n1) Doesn\u0092t further penalize those selling at a loss - prevents the creation of an extra layer of dissatisfaction, that can inhibit further participation in the space.\n\n \n\n\n2) Can positively change the creators\u0092 attitude towards royalties, knowing that they only get a percentage from profits.\n\n \n\n\n3) Help keep momentum in the market by simplifying decisions to sell at a similar price as that of purchase.\n\n \n\n\n4) Build stronger communities around projects & a more positive vibe in the Cardano NFT space by creating a fairer environment.\n\n \n\n\n5) The potential increase in sales volume could generate more revenue for marketplaces - only the initial investment of implementing the feature is required.\n\n \n\n\nThe feature would require marketplaces to track minting prices & all sales regardless of platform. It definitely would add work, but considering part of it already happens, it should be doable.\n\n \n\n\nThis, however, would be made much easier implemented if, for instance, the NFT verification tool https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398378 would also track royalty distribution as has been proposed by NFT Guild members.\n\n \n\n\nOf course, no such system would be 100% accurate, as there\u0092s no way of tracking P2P sales, but at this point, they probably represent only a very small percentage of total sales.\n\n \n\n\nUltimately we have to ask ourselves what is the purpose of royalties?\n\nIf it\u0092s to enable future development, how much can be realistically enabled by 1-3%?\n\n \n\n\nOn the other hand, it can also create the expectation that the creator now has an additional revenue stream, so he/she should be even more dedicated because he\u0092s \u0093getting paid\u0094 to do so.\n\n \n\n\nThis will of course differ from project to project, but in reality, the amount generated by the royalty payments might not be sustainable in the long run.\n\n \n\n\nThis is an evolving topic so we would be interested to hear the communities thoughts on the matter and work together towards exploring it.\n\n \n\n\nAs marketplaces have implemented their own custom solutions for royalty distribution the main objection that has emerged, from both marketplaces and creators around the currently proposed solution, CIP-27 [ https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip27/ ], is that it is too rigid.\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0It cannot be applied retroactively to existing projects, created before the CIP, even as they continue to have some of the largest trade volume.\n\n\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0\u00a0Royalties can only be tied to a single unchangeable address.\n\n\u00a0\u00a03.\u00a0\u00a0The parameters of the royalty token cannot be modified after minting. While we appreciate that it can be argued this is necessary to prevent malicious & \u0093rogue\u0094 creators from jacking up royalty rates on unsuspecting buyers, it also prevents creative or benevolent actions to be taken. For instance, a creator deciding after the fact that he wants to directly route a portion of the royalties to a DAO that has formed around the project, even though this was not the original vision.\u00a0Another example would be using royalties in creative ways to stimulate the adoption of the project, for instance, a royalty rate that starts from 0 but increases over time to stimulate aftermarket action in the early stages of the project, or one that starts high and decreases over time, to put a higher \u0093tax\u0094 on those only interested in the project for short term profits, etc.\n\n \n\n\nFurthermore, widespread community adoption doesn\u0092t seem to be happening and the entrants into the space, prefer implementing their custom solution. For example, https://www.jpg.store , currently the largest NFT marketplace on Cardano, which accounts for over 85% of trade volume (according to https://opencnft.io/market-overview#marketplace - at the time of writing) uses its own custom solution incorporated into their project verification form to gather royalties information from creators and subsequently makes payments based on that info. So does the newly launched https://epoch.art .\n\n \n\n\nThe second most popular marketplace CNFT.io also seems to be using its own custom implementation of royalties, for example, some of the older projects have royalties associated with them, while others do not. It is unclear what is the distinction and how the decision is made.\n\n"}', -- extra

Like Cardano, and its global community, we too want to make this world a better, kinder and more inclusive place, where everyone can have a stake - and a voice! - in shaping their destinies. At Voxiberate we believe that decentralization of the web brings enormous opportunities for communities across the world to self-organize and create new social and economic value. But for this vision to take place, and for Cardano to be adopted by the wider society, it is necessary to introduce concepts and practices from political science in the governance of blockchains. We think we can contribute towards this goal by developing a deliberation platform based on citizen assemblies.\n\n \n\n\nThis layer will be extremely useful to Cardano projects - and indeed to all DAOs - in scaling up and ensuring the trust of their communities, as we will provide a build-to-purpose system for member deliberations (instead of the currently available systems that are mere messaging services)\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nVoxiberate will ultimately deploy a decentralized model of governance based on Cardano. More specifically, we will develop the following features on Cardano:\n\n \n\n\n1. Voting process, as fraud-proof way of voting and/or a verifiable audit trail\n2. Our VOX token, whereby citizens are rewarded for good civic behaviour\n3. Login with wallet\n\n \n\n\nWith regards to the Nation Building Apps Challenge, our product aligns with the Challenge''s goals because we will provide a very powerful tool to introduce the voice of citizens in participatory democratic governance. Sustainable prosperity can only be effected through the active participation of citizens and communities in policy and decision-making. Our proposed solution aligns with the Nation Building Apps challenge, as we will build an application that enables nations, regions, and cities to set up citizen assemblies quickly, easily and at a very low cost.\n\n \n\n\nMore specifically, we align with the following KPIs of the Challenge:\n\n \n\n\n\u0095 Proposers commercial approach and negotiation strategy with different Governments\n\n \n\n\n\u0095 Participation of Cardano''s Local Community Centers\n\n \n\n\n\u0095 Participation and/or partnerships with other international organizations\n\n \n\n\n\u0095 Number of countries covered, contracts signed\n\n \n\n\n\u0095 Number of Dapp users, registry accounts, transaction volumes\n\n \n\n\n\u0095 Proposers lead time on field research, Dapp development and implementation\n\n \n\n\n\u0095 Dapps impact on social/financial inclusion\n\n \n\n\n\u0095 Dapps impact on economic development\n\n \n\n\nWe plan to communicate the outcomes of our project via several channels, including social media channels and conferences.

    '{"solution": "This is a very important question that the proposal considers keenly. In its simplest form, the Cardano Recycling DApp seeks to establish a platform that would encourage waste separation from various sources of waste generation, including institutions (private and government) and recycling agencies. The proposal addresses this challenge by way of providing rewards and incentives to stakeholders (households, private and government institutions, and recycling agencies) in the recycling sector using the DApp and smart contracts.\n\nAgain, the creation of the DApp does not only provide business solutions but also removes middlemen and directly connects households, private, and government institutions to recycling agencies. The smart contract establishes a relationship that enables households, private and government institutions to separate waste from its source as consumers, and the DApp creates an avenue to exchange plastic waste for incentive. The recycling agencies would, through the DApp, engage in direct pick-up. That would save time and cost in plastic waste collection and waste recovery. Hence, reducing production costs and allowing for the smooth operation of recycling processes.\n\nDirectly and indirectly, this proposal would create employment and increase the income of stakeholders involved in the recycling value chain.\n\n \n\n\nOur \\*long-term vision\\* is to extend the usage of this platform from just institutions to households through the creation of a mobile application. With a successful mobile application, it can be guaranteed that the solution will be adopted globally as mobile applications are less difficult to operate and a large percentage of the total population can afford a mobile phone. After successful onboarding, it can then be assured that 98% of recyclable plastic waste generated across the world will end up in the recycling hubs for recycling purposes.\n\n \n\n\n\\*Local/Global Impact?\\*\n\nThis platform is estimated to have three (3) main impacts on the local/global community;\n\nRecycling Agencies: According to research, plastic recycling agencies incur extra costs and time in performing waste segregation and cleansing. Wastes generated in institutions are usually not segregated and thus appear in mixed variants like medical waste, food waste, plastic waste, metal waste, etc., all mixed together. This practice leaves the recyclable plastics among the waste vulnerable and exposed to dirt.\n\n \n\n\nFor recycling activities, the plastic waste that is dirty must be cleansed before continuing with the further process of turning it into PET. This policy implies that recycling agencies who come across such recyclable plastics must incur extra time and cost in ensuring cleansing, and this causes delays in the workflow.\n\n \n\n\nThrough our initiative, waste segregation bins meant only for recyclable plastic waste will be distributed to institutions in addition to education on why they need to practice waste segregation from their point.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nThe impact of this is to cut the extra cost and time that usually needs to be incurred by recycling agencies and boost the workflow as they\u0092re able to focus on recycling and not segregation, which would be done by institutions.\n\n \n\n\nInstitutions: Locally, institutions, which are a good source of recyclable plastic waste, do not get any value from the recyclable plastic waste they generate in their environs. Yet, they pay waste collection agencies for the collection of their waste. This compiled waste is usually a mixture of food waste, metal waste, plastic waste, paper waste, etc.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nThis is due to the fact that most institutions do not know the value of recyclable plastic waste, the benefits of recycling, and the means for practising waste segregation.\n\n \n\n\nThrough our initiative, through the workshop, the various institutions that sign up for the pilot program will be educated on why it is important to practice waste segregation at their point, what the value of recyclable plastic waste is, and lastly, they will be presented with waste segregation bins specifically for recyclable plastic waste collection.\n\n \n\n\nThe impact of this is to ensure that recyclable plastic waste is now seen to be valuable by institutions, and through the incentivization, another revenue gate is opened to them.\n\n \n\n\nEnvironment: What would happen to the external environment of institutions if all their plastic waste was kept within? The answer is, the external environment would almost be free from plastic waste pollution.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nWe believe in this theory because our initiative seeks to empower institutions to encourage all employees and customers to dispose of their used recyclable plastic into the recyclable plastic segregation bin. By doing so, no recyclable plastic waste gets the chance to end up in the oceans and/or on the streets, thus satisfying SDG 1, 12, 13, and 14.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAs said by Kevin Alexander Leon, a United States politician:\n\n\u0093\\*Recycling more plastics can help local businesses and expand jobs while supporting the goals of sustainability.\\*\u0094\n\n \n\n\nRecycling of plastic waste is essential for good climate conditions:\n\n\\*https://www.wwf.org.au/news/blogs/plastic-waste-and-climate-change-whats-the-connection#gs.h3ibit\\*\n\n \n\n\nOur motivation:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/GDFC1dTV7CQ \n\n\n"}', -- extra

The goal behind these films is that they will be made available to the Cardano community to be used at their discretion.\n\n \n\n\nNothing is more frustrating than not knowing how to explain people what you do in a way that they understand right away. An explainer video allows you to offer your flawless pitch anywhere in the globe at any time of day. You are not even required to attend! And, if you pick the appropriate explainer video partner, you can just wind up with your Cardano story, which you can use in pitches, on your website, email marketing, and other places.\n\n \n\n\nYou can simply share your narrative with the rest of the world now that you''ve perfected your pitch. So go ahead and wow them with Cardano knowledge. It''s much simpler to share since you can submit videos to YouTube, Vimeo, and other sites that can be instantly distributed to anybody and seen by thousands, if not millions, of people. You may also bring it to meetings, conferences, and other events. You''ll never have to worry about a bad pitch again.\n\n \n\n\nCardano''s users can take advantage and see a tiny investment transform into a massive profit. Dropbox spent $50,000 on an explanatory film to communicate their narrative. It resulted in 5 million new users and a revenue of more than $24 million. Consider what we could accomplish with Cardano.\n\n \n\n\nAnalytics should be hosted and tracked so that you can research your audience, create better videos, and measure the results. With video heatmaps, you can observe when someone rewinds, pauses, or skips a segment of your movie in real time. All this information is tremendously useful in ensuring that your video is doing the correct thing for Cardano.\n\n \n\n\nFurthermore, these movies may be translated into any language (at the beginning they will be in six languages), making knowledge available to everybody on the planet.\n\n"}', -- extra

This would improve synergies and cement the common standard for authentication. In turn, it could lead to extending this standard to the concept of authorization, so that the same open standard is used for more granular operations (such as issuing a certificate, downloading a file behind a firewall, etc\u0085)\n\n \n\n\nAlthough the initial spec and implementation will be very much inspired by common standards (oAuth2, EIP-4361, W3C DID specs), it will be shared openly (on Github) and could later evolve with proper governance from Catalyst member''s votes, in the hope that it could even form the basis for a Cardano Improvement Proposal in the future.\n\n \n\n\nA small marketing budget is sought to make the crypto community at large aware of the project once delivered.\n\n"}', -- extra

Our NFT platform aims to solve business needs providing a place where they can onboard their users, there will also be an open NFTs marketplace so experienced users that are now merely collecting NFTs on other chains, will have many reasons to bridge because we offer new use cases and more features.\n\n \n\n\nAn increase of companies that will be using directly Cardano for all their NFT operations will exponentially grow usage of the mainnet, as companies will redirect their customers to transact on the blockchain for every activity related to NFTs. Please consider that companies that will adopt the platform, will use their marketing channels to specifically drive traffic to Cardano through our platform.\n\n \n\n\nDid our efforts result in new, viable applications built on top of Cardano?\n\n \n\n\nWe think is time for new useful NFTs use cases to emerge and be widely adopted, for achieving this goal we are building out a platform to lower the entry barrier for people to create, manage and exploit the power of NTFs.

It aims to have an impact by giving big attention to the community-growth side, empowering it with keys and tools to be fairly governed and autonomous in the future. With such a foundation, the local ecosystem could evolve in a sustainable way.\n\nTo concretize the desired outcome, the methodology by which the program unfolds:\n\nSourcing phase:\n\nThis phase will be focused on creating interest around the project and marketing it to the local blockchain community. This will be achieved through various tools such as teaser videos, educational videos and events aiming to create community growth.\n\nDuring the sourcing phase, the community will be incentivized to contribute to the program success and get rewarded through a tokenization process. By the end of the sourcing phase, one or more hackathons will be organized by Dar Blockchain in which the winning teams will qualify for the catalyst program.\n\nCatalyst phase:\n\nIn this phase, we mainly focus on building the infrastructure of decentralized governance entities for the community in the form of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Then, hosting teams with blockchain related ideas.\n\nWe will provide the teams with a nest to mature their ideas from a business point of view as well as technical feasibility and involve the community in the selection phase using a voting system. Community involvement is rewarded by the token.\n\nIncubation phase:\n\nIn this phase, we will incubate 6 to 8 projects that have been voted on via the DAO. Incubation is a training and mentoring program that aims to help participants create advanced proof of concept, strengthen their community, gain access to industry experts, and confirm utility as a product market fit solution. Experts and mentors are evaluated by the teams, and rewarded by the community token.\n\nFunding phase:\n\nIncubated teams set a soft cap and hard cap for their funding needs. The program delegates the decision making of fund allocation to the community. Based on the following token distribution percentage, the community stakes their tokens to their chosen projects: 50% to the engaged community rewards, 20% to the experts and mentors, and 30% to the program partners.\n\nThe projects that reach their Soft cap, are funded."}', -- extra

We are also actively partnering up with other proposers for avoiding redundancies and for maximising benefits for the Cardano Community.\n\n \n\n\nIn a first step, due to our proximity to Brussels and senior partner\u0092s available expertise, DLT360 will put emphasis on EU legislation - which is crucial for the global success of Cardano, due to the far reaching impact EU norms have world wide - from the areas of data privacy to financial regulation. The project works in two steps:\n\n \n\n\n\\* First, DLT360\u0092s Regulatory segment continuous building a body of research on upcoming legislation from the ground up in order to form a solid foundation for future lobbying efforts.\n\n \n\n\n\\* Second, this research is put to use to strategically comment during consultation phases of the European Commission when they arise, which we are consistently monitoring.\n\n \n\n\nAs legislative efforts in the EU pertaining to blockchain technology gain traction, these consultations are an important opportunity for stakeholders to voice their concerns. In the past, such consultations were held for example on an upcoming EU regulatory framework for crypto-assets, as well as taxation measures for crypto-assets.\n\n \n\n\nOur work is not a ''one-off'' effort, but is part of our overall DLT360 Risk and Opportunity Management framework.

    '{"solution": "Our aim is to build a one stop premium minting solution for all the requirements that a project needs. In recent days there has been a lot of talk about the prevalent minting systems and its flaws, so certainly there is a want of a new norm that can enable a smooth experience for buyers and sellers both.\n\nCurrently, the most widely used model of minting NFTs is where the Buyer sends a payment to the Seller who then proceeds to mint the said NFT and then returns it. This means that there are at least two transactions that occur in such an exchange. This method is very inefficient.\n\nCardano''s EUTXO model means that multiple exchanges, mints and script executions can occur inside one transaction. This project just leverages those capabilities and proves a way of minting a token without revealing the script''s private keys to the end user. This means that the buyer makes the payment and the seller mints and returns the NFT in the same transaction.\n\nThe benefits of this new model are:\n\n? Maximum Efficiency\n? Minimum Costs\n? Less Congestion\n? Absolute Transparency\n\nWith this mechanism sellers don''t have to worry about any refunds at all and buyers don''t have to wait long hours for their NFTs to arrive after sending their precious ADA.\nYou can test it yourself on https://testnet.rarety.io/\nOur platform will drive adoption of a better minting experience in the community with multi-sig at its core."}', -- extra

In particular, the shortage of development funds and engineers is serious, and students have few opportunities to get these resources. However, Catalysts are easier to raise money than VCs(Venture Capital) and Business Contests, and also can connect globally with engineers in this community. However, the number of proposals to Catalysts is increasing rapidly, and the community does not easily notice small-scale proposals from students. In addition, it is difficult to set a clear Roadmap while resources are scarce and to get a high evaluation from CA(Community Advisor).\n\nTherefore, to make it easier for the community to recognize new ideas from students, we will establish a new Category exclusively for students. In addition, instead of the roadmap being ambiguous, we set a budget limit of $ 5,000. By doing so, many students can experience funding from Catalyst. In continued participation in Catalyst, funding experience, even on a small scale, is evaluated by the community. Therefore, it is important to set a budget limit.\n\nThe Category Goal is to encourage engineers to scout students who are evaluated by the community and create a new team to join the next Fund with a clear Roadmap. This is a benefit for both students and engineers to raise a large salary for engineers through Catalyst rather than from VCs or Banks.\n\n\\\\*\\\\*Team & Relevant experience\\\\*\\\\*\n\n?Issa Ichikawa (Twitter: https://twitter.com/Cardano\\\\_ISSA)\n\n21-year-old/Junior at Waseda University in Japan/Student entrepreneur/Catalyst Fund6 raiser/Catalyst CA/Catalyst Fund6 Challenge Team Member (Connecting Japan Community)\n\n?YUTA\u00a0(Twitter: https://twitter.com/yuta\\\\_cryptox)\n\nCardano Ambassador/SPO/Japan representative of Eastern Town Hall Meeting/Catalyst Fund2,6,7 raiser/Catalyst CA/Catalyst Fund6 Challenge Team Member (Connecting Japan Community)", "importance": "Most student entrepreneurs are suffering from resource shortages, especially in funding and engineer recruitment.", "goal": "By setting up a student category and increasing the exposure of their ideas, they can expect easier funding and scouted from engineers.", "metrics": "?Number of proposals for this category\n\n?Number of applause and comments from the community\n\n?Number of proposals that could be collaborated with other engineers\n\n?Number of proposals that participated in the next fund"}', -- extra

The team has the experience and network to scale such a solution and integrate it with B2B relevant systems.

As we scale, the no-code tooling from ProofSpace\u0092s SaaS platform will enable any hospitality, agency or operator to sign up and start leveraging PRISM credentials and interacting with customers.\\*\n\\* \\*Interoperability\\*: The ProofSpace wallet already contains Indy credentials and their implementation of PRISM would enable hospitality enterprises already using Indy credentials in Indy networks to be included in PRISM trust networks as well.\n\\* \\*Business models: this project will eventually align its business model to the familiar models in hospitality - monthly or annual subscriptions. In the future, new business models may arise from using verifiable credentials - for example where partners or related services form affiliate marketing networks and enable referral compensation and loyalty programmes for customers using services within those networks\\*\n\n \n\n\nThe proposal aligns with a key metric in this challenge:\n\n\\* \\*The number of proposals that directly address SSI in a quantifiable manner:\\* \u00a0this will result in a production launch of the eRevMax booking engine utilising PRISM credentials to process hotel bookings. Downstream, each hotel will be able to utilise ProofSpace no-code tooling to complete hotel check-in, room entry and billing processes using PRISM credentials, potentially resulting in 100s of new production instances for PRISM, and 1000s of new credentials being issued/verified.

    '{"solution": "Metrics:\n\n \n\n\nOur proposal addresses the challenge of on-chaining gamers, but we are doing it in a different way. We are targeting a different sector of gamers (physical rather than digital). The demand for games is quite high in the physical games market, not just in the digital games market. Here are some stats on the tabletop game industry:\n\n \n\n\n\"The majority of survey respondents, 57%, own between 1 and 25 board and card games, while 22% have between 26 and 50. \"\n\n \n\n\n\"Despite already having many games in their possession, collectors aren''t showing any signs of stopping. In the past year, the majority of gamers (41%) purchased five to ten new games or expansions.\"\n\n \n\n\nhttps://printninja.com/board-game-industry-statistics\n\n \n\n\nDuring our initial talks with manufacturers, the demand for new card game and tabletop game products is so high, that 3 out of 5 of our shortlisted manufacturers are not accepting new orders at this time.\n\n \n\n\nHere are the core metrics we would be measuring:\n\n \n\n\n- Number of game copies sold to retailers.\n\n- Number of game copies bought by consumers.\n\n- Number of wallets on Cardano holding Captivate Early Access FTs.\n\n- Number of Captivate Early Access FT sets redeemed (after release).\n\n- Number of retailers onboarded (brick & mortar and online stores).\n\n- Number of followers or subscribers to our social media accounts.\n\n- Captivate organic community growth (community created content, community event participation, partnerships).\n\n- Website traffic generated by QR code information links (after release).\n\n \n\n\nSustainability Metrics:\n\n \n\n\nLong term, we are looking to create our game products in a manner that is more sustainable than what has been available in the tabletop game industry in the past.\n\n \n\n\nWe will work with our manufacturer to be able to achieve as many of these options over the short term as possible, and to ideally implement all of them eventually.\n\n \n\n\nThe goal is to maintain a superb product for collectors and players without adding additional waste. Some of these sustainable alternatives are:\n\n \n\n\n- Use of as much paper as possible instead of foil or plastic.\n\n \n\n\n- Paper packaging made from semi-recycled or fully recycled paper sourced from responsible forests.\n\n \n\n\n- Alternative ways of offsetting environmental cost of products, like donating a portion of product sales to tree planting & plastic cleanup.\n\n \n\n\nFor tree planting, we would like to make donations to the Cardano Forest through Veritree from every product sold. This would add another way for gamers to connect with Cardano:\n\n \n\n\nhttps://www.veritree.com\n\n \n\n\nGAIA Stake Pool is already working with Veritree as part of the Climate Neutral Cardano Group (CNCG): https://www.climateneutralcardano.org\n\n \n\n\nFor plastic cleanup, we will donate to The Ocean Cleanup:\n\n \n\n\nhttps://theoceancleanup.com\n\n \n\n\nHere are the core metrics we would be measuring for sustainability:\n\n \n\n\n- ADA donated to Veritree.\n\n- Number of trees planted with Veritee.\n\n- ADA & dollars donated to The Ocean Cleanup.\n\n- Amount of new material used in game production.\n\n- Amount of plastic reduced from game production (when compared to a similar product).\n\n- Amount of recycled material used and quality of recycled material used in game production (% of pre-consumer waste, % of post-consumer waste, FSC certified).\n\n \n\n\nEducating about Cardano:\n\n \n\n\nWe will add 3-4 information card inserts to each deck that would have further details about Veritree and the Cardano Forest, GAIA Stake Pool, and Cardano in general.\u00a0These cards will also have QR codes on them to give gamers a quick way to get further information from websites.\n\n \n\n\nCardano Pop Culture:\n\n \n\n\nCard artwork features many SPOs, characters, and projects from Cardano pop culture. Digital FT assets have links to the social media accounts and websites of those featured on cards.\n\n \n\n\nConnecting New Audiences to Cardano:\n\n \n\n\nFuture Captivate editions with different themes to reach and connect different audiences together. After Captivate: Cardano Edition is complete, we have Captivate: Cryptid Edition scheduled next to tie in with our podcast \"Rocky Mountain Cryptids\":\n\n \n\n\nhttps://www.rockymountaincryptids.com\n\n \n\n\nWe''ll be able to use the podcast to advertise all our Captivate products, and connect the cryptid audience to the Cardano audience.\n\n \n\n\nOur last Captivate product currently scheduled is Captivate: Fantasy Edition, which will connect the fantasy audience to the Cardano audience.\n\n \n\n\nWe currently also have 2 other tabletop games in our schedule to be developed and produced in the future. Ideally we can follow the same theming model as Captivate to attract players to Cardano.\n\n \n\n\nThese two games are an Untitled Dungeon Crawler, and an Untitled RPG Card Game. Initial theme would be focused on Cardano, and later themes would target audiences from different groups, with a way to connect all audiences together.\n\n \n\n\nFurther Digital Integration:\n\n \n\n\nAt a later stage, we could develop a Captivate Dapp for mobile, but that is beyond the scope of our current project.\n\n \n\n\nWe understand that gamers who''d like to play Captivate may not be able to do so in person, or would like a way to try out the game.\n\n \n\n\nA solution to this would be to create a digital version of Captivate in Tabletop Simulator, available on Steam. Tabletopia is another great place to digitize Captivate, as it is available for free. These options would be something we''d likely explore after the physical version of Captivate has already been released.\n\n \n\n\nhttps://www.tabletopsimulator.com\n\n \n\n\nhttps://tabletopia.com/\n\n"}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "As in Africa, raising the awareness levels of regular people in East Asia about blockchain and the Cardano network should be a priority for the Catalyst community. In this challenge, we provide funding for people who have learned about Cardano to take advantage of the community''s support and build on or use the Cardano network.\n\n \n\n\nThe nature of the proposals for this challenge is open-ended. Their only requirement is to originate or focus on East Asia and include East Asian team members or focus on East Asian participants.\n\n \n\n\nFor instance, the overwhelming majority of Stake Pools reside in North America and Europe. The Cardano network will be more resilient when Stake Pools are evenly distributed across the globe. The Catalyst community needs to step up and intentionally make that happen.\n\n \n\n\nCardano started life in East Asia \\*(Japan and Hong Kong)\\*, and Emurgo focuses on East Asia. Let''s build upon that.\n\n \n\n\nWhat this is\n\n \n\n\nA call to action; Activate the Cardano community''s ability to recognise, reward the opportunity to make the world a better place. East Asia is fertile ground for the adoption of Cardano. The return on intention (ROI) is likely to be high because projects in young and developing economies face less economic inertia.\n\n \n\n\nAddressing different parts of the world directly and intentionally through funding challenges makes our community more accessible. It makes us more resilient. It helps us learn and understand the needs of communities that make up our ecosystem.\n\n \n\n\nIt is a vision that needs votes to become an achievement. When the challenge succeeds, the beneficiary is the whole Cardano community. It is a call to close our prejudices and open our eyes, hearts and minds to good people who lack the benefits many of us were born with\u0097allowing others with fewer privileged circumstances to rise and succeed.\n\n", "importance": "The Cardano community leans heavily toward North America and Europe. Growth elsewhere requires our support and initiative as a community.\n\n", "goal": "A broad spectrum of people across Asia and connected to Asia, coming together and forming teams to grow our ecosystem.\n\n", "metrics": "At the end of this challenge, we will be asking ourselves some questions about the quality of participation :\n\n  \n\n\n1. The number of proposals originating from East Asian participants in Project Catalyst\n2. The quantity and quality of funded proposals originating from East Asian teams\n3. The observed impact of funded projects *(meeting their KPIs)*\n4. Did we increase the participation of the Cardano community and Catalyst teams with East Asian residents?\n5. Was there an increase in Daily/Monthly Active Wallets *(DAW/MAW)* as a proxy measure of momentum and engagement\n6. Did we increase the number of Stake Pools and Stake Pool Operators based in East Asia?\n\n  \n\n\nWe will also be asking some specific questions about the quality of the proposals :\n\n  \n\n\n1. Is there good feedback on funded project progress, failure or success that help us understand the nuances of deploying Cardano solutions across East Asia?\n2. What is the novelty and appropriateness of solutions?\n3. Are we on track to improve the lives of people using Cardano in East Asia?\n4. Was social and environmental impact evaluation used to measure proposal performance?\n5. What is the sustainability of proposals beyond the scope of Catalyst?\n"}', -- extra

    '{"solution": " \n\n\nAccording to the National Center for Education Statistics, approximately 3.7 million students in the United States graduated from high school in the 2018-2019 school year. During the 2019-2020 school year, the breakdown of degrees earned by college students is:\n\n-1,018,000 associate degrees\n\n-2,038,000 bachelors degrees\n\n-843,000 masters degrees\n\n-190,000 doctorates\n\n \n\n\nThese are foundational credentials that can be added to an individual''s digital ID. In that same year, BurningGlass noted in their Credentials Matter Phase 2 report that 30 states reported that K-12 students in their states earned 1,320,212 credentials beyond a diploma. We believe that these numbers will grow exponentially over the next decade as more and more states focus on accelerating their students workforce readiness skills through various workforce development/ work based learning initiatives.\n\n \n\n\nWhy the emphasis on workforce development & work based learning? In 2018 Korn Ferry released a report titled Future of Work the Global Talent Crunch that predicted that there will be a global talent shortage of more than 85 million people resulting in almost $8.5 trillion in unrealized revenue by the year 2030. This equates to a loss of an estimated $1.7 trillion in the United States alone. COVID-19 has only accelerated the labor shortage that the Korn Ferry report predicted.\n\n \n\n\nEmsi highlighted this problem in their 2021 report titled Demographic Drought: How the Approaching Sansdemic Will Transform the Labor Market for the Rest of Our Lives. This report estimates that the US will have a talent deficit of six million people by the year 2028. They identified three factors that resulted in the acceleration of the labor shortage. They are:\n\n \n\n\n1) Record numbers of baby boomers left the market in 2020.\n\n \n\n\n2) Millions of Prime Age workers left the job market or opted for part-time work.\n\n \n\n\n3) The United States experienced the lowest birthrate in our nation''s history.\n\n \n\n\nWe have to rethink education and workforce development strategies in order to overcome these factors. The report goes on to recommend that employers and schools focus on three areas:\n\n \n\n\n1) Recruit beyond traditional demographics\n\n \n\n\n2) Invest in programs to reskill and realign the existing workforce\n\n \n\n\n3) Focus their efforts on retaining the students & employees they already have.\n\n \n\n\nLabor shortages are rapidly changing the hiring practices of employers. Businesses have to reimagine their talent acquisition strategies if they even have one at all. They have to explore and develop new pipelines for talent. As the demand for talent grows, employers are looking to high school students to fill those entry-level gaps through internships and youth apprenticeships.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nOur DApp can play a crucial role in helping to fill those gaps and allow HR departments to identify and hire young talent quickly. It will also help businesses find existing employees with related skills for open positions. Our app will allow companies to up-skill those employees through various training programs and issue or verify new credentials earned to fill those needed positions, creating an opportunity for companies to develop an internal talent pipeline to stay competitive in this challenging labor market.\n\n"}', -- extra

    '{"solution": "Book Token will create a digital book marketplace and exchange where anyone can collect, read and then resell what they buy - just like print books. Harnessing NFTs on Cardano, we are creating a decentralized ecosystem that allows readers to finally own their digital books. When readers consume their books, they will be rewarded in our native token $BOOK, which we are calling knowledge mining (a read-to-earn system).\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nThis ecosystem unlocks new revenue opportunities for authors and publishers to make money in perpetuity on ongoing sales, setting up smart contracts to pay themselves, charities, and other social impact organizations.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nBuilding true utility through the power of the Cardano blockchain will onboard massive amounts of new users in the community as readers begin to demand ownership of their digital assets. The following impact is inevitable:\n\n \n\n\n\\* Digital books become individual and unique assets that add scarcity and inventory control\n\\* Readers own, instead of license, their digital books and can resell them in an open market\n\\* Publishers & Authors receive royalties on all future second-hand sales\n\\* Ability to create collective versions, limited editions, and nearly infinite marketing combinations\n\\* Ability to bundle physical print books with book NFTs\n\\* Ability to partner with brands for bulk distribution\n\\* Increased security and digital rights management\n\\* Publishers & Authors will be able to anonymously market to anyone who holds or has owned, particular titles\n\\* Ability to verify reading with radically change education\n\n \n\n\nThe mass-market, readers & publishers, don\u0092t understand and are fearful of blockchain technology. However, unlocking the utility of Cardano for this market on an easy-to-use platform, can lead to onboarding hundreds of millions of readers and billions of dollars in digital assets.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n"}', -- extra

It is a small but ever growing part of the Cardano ecosystem. We believe that in time it''ll become an important and ever present part of the ecosystem. It is therefore with this proposal that we look to begin bridging the gap between the Catalyst process and the broader Cardano ecosystem.\n\n \n\n\nThe initial experiment was under the stewardship of the IO team and with the requirements of a corporate entity they chose an existing platform with an existing track record in the ideation space. However, as the community has embraced the Project and its goal, many who have participated in the Catalyst process have identified the flaws and shortcomings of using an existing one-size-fits-all solution and have repeatedly asked for the development of an alternative. With this proposal we hope to offer a way of offering a solution\u00a0 and a way forward for both IO and the community. One that will start to fulfill on the promise of offering a community created and developed solution that is expandable, adjustable, flexible and decentralized. One where the community has access to the data and can participate in its development and its future.\n\n \n\n\nTechnical details\n\nAfter the definition of a data schema for a proposal (mainly based on the data structure currently in use) we will develop a SPA (Single Page Application) web-app that will allow proposers to draft and create their own proposal.\n\n \n\n\nThe web-app will be connected to web-based Cardano wallets (like Nami, Flint, CC-Vault, GameChanger Wallet) and will allow proposers to submit their finalized project directly on-chain, taking advantage of transactions metadata.\n\n \n\n\nExample process for Proposers\n\n\\* The user opens the tool and prepares the proposal in a user friendly UI, according to the data structure\n\\* The proposal is saved locally in the browser (in future iterations it could be temporary saved in a centralized environment to allow sharing before the final submission)\n\\* The user submits the proposal:\n\\* The tool will:\n\\* Parse local data and organize it according to the defined protocol\n\\* Generate transaction metadata containing the proposal\n\\* Create and submit the transaction with his data (min fee of 0.17 ADA required per submission)\n\\* Data are stored immutably and forever on chain\n\\* Can be anonymous (if you keeps their wallet anonymous)\n\\* Data for the subsequent process (like Assess and Governance) can be aggregated directly querying the blockchain\n\\* \n\nOutcome: complete transparency - censorship resistance - data not alterable/tamperable - open to anyone to participate - open to anyone to build tools and integrations\n\n"}', -- extra

    '{"solution": "OUOD\u0092s mentor-matching solution is designed to build trusted relationships, based on cross over between the mentors current skills, both personal and professional, and the mentees desired state. The matching logic is based on a concept called \u0091near-peer mentorship\u0092, which means the mentor is a couple of steps ahead of the mentee in a specific area of development. This means the learning gap is wide enough that the mentor can add value to the mentee, based on their experience, but not so wide that the experience is no longer present and relevant for the mentor. This create a value exchange that is valuable for both the mentee and the mentor.\n\n \n\n\nThrough effective and engaging mentor matches, new Catalyst members can receive the guidance they need to access the opportunities that are most relevant to them, gain confidence in their ability to participate in roles, take on more responsibility and deepen networks within the community.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis proposal covers the product development work required to build out the pool functionality and to run a Catalyst pilot mentor-matching program for three months.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nOur solution will provide the following components:\n\n \n\n\n\\* Mentoring platform powered by a machine learning matching engine\n\\* Automatically proposes high-quality mentor matches\n\\* Administrator dashboard allows program managers to make and monitor matches\n\\* User dashboard for updating profile, preferences and responding to matches\n\\* Best practice mentoring tools are built into the platform to support mentors and mentees in roles\n\\* Catalyst mentoring pool, promoted to the Catalyst community and discoverable for OneUpOneDown users\n\n \n\n\nOneUpOneDown''s programme is designed so users can be matched on an ongoing basis.

KemiLand Ambassadors will established facilities for such joyful experience. and charge tickets according to local market condition. KemiLand shall only receive 1 ada for each visit.

Citizens are holding KemiLand digital assets and therefor contributing and profiting from KemiLand.

    '{"solution": "Our proposed solution addresses the challenge by focusing on user acquisition, engagement and retention. These will be the factors in determining whether players choose the Cardano blockchain as their preferred blockchain for gaming.\n\n\\\\*\\\\*User Acquisition, Engagement and Retention\\\\*\\\\*\n\nUser acquisition can be easily done through the sale of NFT-artworks on jpg.store. Our project is aiming to launch our first NFT collection on jpg.store''s launchpad for an upcoming cohort. Marketing of the NFT collection will be coordinated with the team at jpg.store.\n\nProspective players need to collect at least one NFT-artwork in order to gain access into the game world. These NFT-artworks will be in the form of profile-pictures, which depict two characters and a pet animal.\n\nUser engagement can be achieved through players participating in the storyline content. We can measure the engagement by analysing the participation and completion rates. The amount of rewards distributed and the number of minted NFT-events for storyline completion are other indicators for user engagement.\n\nUser retention can be achieved using a high quality graphics rendering solution such as realtime raytracing, which allows the players to have a sense of pleasure. The image attached to this proposal is a cottage scene that is rendered in Magicavoxel using path-tracing. That illustrates our visual concept of what it should look like under real-time raytracing conditions.\n\n\\\\*\\\\*Platforms and Devices\\\\*\\\\*\n\nUnfortunately, not all players have the necessary graphics hardware or devices that can run realtime raytracing solutions. In order to allow these players to run the application successfully with good performance, we will also have to identify existing graphical solutions that can approximate features of global illumination, such as precomputed radiance transfer (spherical harmonic lighting).\n\nThe game application will be implemented on mobile platforms(iOS & Android) first before porting over to desktop platforms. This is because our current infrastructure and applications are currently built for mobile(iOS). We use the mobile platform as a baseline implementation, before porting the application over to desktop platforms(PC & Mac).\n\n\\\\*\\\\*Usage of NFTs\\\\*\\\\*\n\nOur solution will use Cardano-based NFTs for additional authentication into the game server, so only investors in our NFT-artworks will have access into the game world.\n\nThe NFT-artworks we intend to create include world & regional maps that are to be generated from our procedural world map generation tool. This can be used to determine which game world the player wants to participate in and it can also be used to unlock access to specific storyline content that is related to the map.\n\nAnother category of our NFT-artworks is character professions, which will allow players to access a range of character skills and specific content that are related to the profession as specified in the NFT''s metadata.\n\nSince there is limited supply of these NFT-artworks, players will be able to trade them on the NFT-marketplace if they want to change their access to a different world/region or change their character profession or simply resell them to another buyer who wants to play the game.\n\nWith respect to the event-based NFTs that we mentioned earlier, these are for recording historical storyline events onto the blockchain, so they will not be sold directly on the NFT-marketplaces.\n\nAs mentioned before, these NFTs will be used as a prerequisite for access to subsequent or upcoming story events.\n\nIn order to differentiate with Metaverses which commonly allow land ownership using NFTs, we can allow ownership in the form of mercantile licenses using NFTs. This is because the game project uses a medieval fantasy theme where the nobility owns the land, similar to medieval history in our real-world.\n\n\\\\*\\\\*Play-to-Earn\\\\*\\\\*\n\nWith regards to play-to-earn features, we will use only one deflationary fungible token that has a limited supply, that allows for staking and voting. In order to encourage players to invest in the fungible token, we can incentive it using staking rewards, dependent on the level of their NFT-characters.\n\nThese fungible tokens will be issued as rewards for major storyline completions. A fixed supply of these tokens will only be issued as rewards for a particular storyline and they will be rewarded to players who own specific NFT-characters. The fungible tokens are also used for unlocking premium character professions and to level-up the NFT-characters."}', -- extra

    '{"solution": "Scope:\n\n \n\n\nOur aim with this Catalyst proposal is to build a solid foundation for our medium and long-term vision for the project.\n\n \n\n\nThe most fundamental component of this is recruiting the right team for the job.\n\n \n\n\nOnce that is achieved our efforts will turn to world-building and game prototyping for the next few months, with a focus on three main pillars:\n\n \n\n\n1. Completing and adapting the world-building and character development - writing & concept art\n\n2. Game mechanics prototyping\n\n3. Tokenomics & NFT distribution models\n\n \n\n\nDuring the first 18 months, we had previously worked on the project (2009-2010) we have completed much of the backstory and have written an extensive script for what was to be a AAA quality adventure game. A wide range of concept art was also created to support the world (see the attached images for examples). In fact, the NFT series that we have released this year is based on that concept art.\n\nHowever, the work needs to be adapted to fit the new direction in which we intend to take the project.\n\n \n\n\nAs part of this effort we are also looking at ways the player/user might generate new NFTs, for now, potential directions we are exploring are based on upgrading through gameplay and/or collecting.\n\n \n\n\nThe purpose of this Catalyst proposal is not only to hopefully secure the funds needed to lay the foundations of a potentially successful fictional universe, but also to serve as a way of introducing our project to a wider audience and to perhaps serve as a launchpad for further funding opportunities. All that while also being a great way of gathering constructive feedback.\n\n \n\n\nWe intend to use the Catalyst process and funds to validate the project and to build solid foundations that will allow us to freely experiment and iterate, and ultimately deliver the best results.\n\n \n\n\nAlthough developing code is not planned for Phase 1 of the project, the scope of this proposal, we plan to open-source any blockchain-related technology we later develop - i.e. the smart contracts and other components our NFT based experience will rely on.\n\n \n\n\nWhy Trybbles?\n\n \n\n\nTrybbles already has a proven track record of popularity, with over 4000 NFTs minted by the community since the launch of the project this summer. We have a relatively large organic following on Twitter & a Discord community of members actively invested in the project.\n\n \n\n\nApproach\n\n \n\n\nOn the blockchain infrastructure, we have the ability to create a new paradigm of digital interactions, one based on provable, trackable ownership & contributions, and start laying a small part of the foundations of what can become a future open and inclusive metaverse.\n\n \n\n\nBut while doing so we also have the opportunity to reevaluate and rebuild how our legacy social constructs function, particularly those related to corporate governance, equitable compensation, and the relationships between the entities in an organization.\n\n \n\n\nWe plan to experiment with new approaches, both in our relationship with our community and our potential future team.\n\n \n\n\nFor our community, we have already introduced the Trybbles Club based on NFT Key, a Cardano NFT authenticator service that grants special access to holders of Trybbles NFTs, and we see multiple ways in which this could evolve in the future.\n\n \n\n\nWhile assembling the team to work on this project we will look for teammates, not employees, and seek to compensate them fairly and equitably according to their realistic desires, not their needs. Humans should be treated as more than self-replicating workers. Humans are not a resource to be extracted. (HR)\n\n \n\n\nWe will do so not only for efficiency\u0092s sake, as we have discovered through experience that a hierarchically flat and an equitable setting leads to increased productivity and overall better outcomes in a creative setting (where the production of a creative product is the end-goal), but hopefully also to set an example to be followed in the transition to a new social and digital paradigm.\n\n \n\n\nWhat\u0092s the importance of DLTs if we use them just to replicate current economic models? Should we just adapt the practices of the status-quo, where creatives are paid exploitative rates by studios with a model where creatives are paid exploitative rates by blockchain communities while others profit?\n\n \n\n\nWhy are we dedicating ourselves to Catalyst, is it simply for technological reasons?\n\n \n\n\nIt is likely that we will continue to develop the Trybbles universe for the foreseeable future in some form with or without Catalyst funding, however being funded would enable us to dramatically scale up our efforts, at a much faster pace and move the project into the development of interactive entertainment products built on top of the Cardano blockchain.\n\n \n\n\nConclusion\n\n \n\n\nThe incredibly positive impacts of gaming on blockchain adoption and usage are well documented. Without going into a very detailed analysis of the subject, we would like to point out that Axie Infinity, currently the most popular blockchain game in the world, has been responsible several times for the highest volume of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n \n\n\nWe will add that we view Axie Infinity as a great showcase of what is technically possible when combining blockchain and gaming, but not so much as a truly fleshed-out game in itself. It\u0092s not a product that would attract an audience in the mainstream gaming community, simply based on its merits as a game, without the promise of large amounts of money that can be earned playing it.\n\n \n\n\nWe have also written a Twitter thread on this subject, please see for reference.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/newmindflow/status/1454376147203002369\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nA game that features NFTs needs to be, first and foremost a fun and engaging experience. NFTs should be treated as \"infrastructure\" elements, that enable new game mechanics and not be treated as the main focus of the game. That''s why what''s currently on the market, even the most popular titles, feel more like showcases for NFTs, rather than actual games.\n\n \n\n\nNote: Throughout this proposal, and in general, we will avoid using the term \u0093metaverse\u0094, as currently it\u0092s misunderstood & misused. Building the foundations of, and fighting for an open metaverse, accessible to all, is embedded in our mission, however in most cases today, the term is simply used as a hype inducer, not as an actual descriptive or useful word. The metaverse will be the totality of all digital experiences seamlessly integrated into one continuous flow and does not characterize a product, set of products, or a company. To say something along the lines of \u0093we are building our metaverse\u0094 is simply dumb and/or dishonest. (It would be like saying \u0093I\u0092m building my own universe\u0094 when starting the construction of a house - sure it\u0092s a nice metaphor, but it would be almost certainly interpreted as such, which is not the case here.)\n\n \n\n\nOtherwise, we\u0092re just calling games & digital experiences \u0093metaverse(s)\u0094 for the sole purpose of hyping them.\n\n"}', -- extra

    '{"solution": "Account = wallet\n\n \n\n\nAvatarada will take care of verifying wallet accounts. Each wallet is a separate account, and the staking key that connects payment addresses will become a login.\n\n \n\n\nUsers can register/verify wallets with different methods:\n\n \n\n\n1. The simple method available for any wallet software, including CLI, is to send a small, randomly selected amount to the first payment address within a specific timeframe. Although the payment is not sent to any external or Avatarada address, it involves a small transaction fee.\n2. The second method utilizes the message signing feature that some wallets like ccvault, Nami, etc., provide. The benefit of this method is that it avoids sending any transactions/fees. Since each wallet has a different API, Avatadara needs to implement and support as many wallet options as possible.\n\n \n\n\nAfter creating a verified account, the process of logging in to different websites or mobiles apps will be similar to the \"Login with Google, Twitter, Facebook, etc.\u0094 buttons commonly found across the internet. However, users will not have to provide their passwords to websites they want to sign in to. At the same time, Avatarada informs users of \"scopes\" provided to a website before they agree to sign in.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSpeeding up development\n\n \n\n\nWebsites will not only get the wallet id (staking key) of the signed-in user, but they can also request additional public information about the wallet, such as the current balance, list of payment addresses, list of tokens/NFTs on the wallet, etc. Providing that information saves time and money on infrastructure for developers because they do not have to deploy nodes with db-sync or similar software, simplifying the entire development process.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCommunication with users\n\n \n\n\nIn the crypto space, wallet owners prefer to stay anonymous. The purpose of Avatarada is to provide websites with the required minimum amount of personal information about the user. On the other hand, personal information such as an email address is commonly used by websites to notify users about transactional updates or promotional announcements. Avatarada solves that problem by allowing websites to send messages to users that previously signed in through Avatarada API. Users will see those messages in the Inbox section. For users that added and verified additional communication channels such as an email or Telegram, Avatarada can send an additional notification to that communication channel with the information about the notification and the content. Avatarada will not provide personal information to websites, but websites can send transactional messages without knowing emails. Allowing websites to send messages to only previously signed-in users will avoid spamming. Users can also manage their inbox and choose to block or allow transactional messages only.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCommunication channels\n\n \n\n\nAs explained previously, users can add and verify emails, Telegram, or other communication channels that Avatarada can send notifications to. An essential part of communication channels is allowing Callback URI. Avatarada will send structured requests from websites to the user''s Callback URI. As a result, connecting a payment gateway or automatizing bidding on NFT marketplaces will become a simple task. It also provides more space for the convenient implementation of different ideas, resulting in more opportunities for developers built on the same standard.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPublic wallet information\n\n \n\n\nCommunication channels linked to a user account have to be verified. For example, a newly added email address will get a confirmation code, a domain must be verified with TXT record in DNS, etc. Verified contact information, including the uploaded avatar, can also become public if the user desires. Services such as blockchain explorers or wallets can use Avatarada API to request and display public information. Since only verified contact information can become public, showing a verified domain name or an email address can help fight scams.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPublic wallet key\n\n \n\n\nThe public key is unknown to others by default. Revealing the public key to Avatarada is not dangerous, but it will allow Avatarada to generate new, unused payment addresses for the wallet. The new address may be useful for billing, generating invoices, receiving tokens, etc. Avatarada can generate a new, unused address and provide it to the service the user is signed in to.\n\n"}', -- extra

Our regional content will help native speakers to learn about Cardano.\u00a0The website and communication channels will act as discussion forums and inform them about pioneer programmes and how to get involved. The outreach activities will take the information to those who are not aware of Cardano. The talent is definitely there. It can be assumed that there will also be sufficient interest to get involved. What is lacking is the ease of information access and guidance for the local population. This project intends to bridge that gap.\n2. This challenge recognises that IT in India is well established with a large pool of talent but that the majority is yet to know about Cardano and the Catalyst funding. Given the language diversity and the statistics about the number of native speakers compared to English speakers in India, we believe that our regional language content, website and outreach activity will boost developer adoption.\u00a0Cardano has a steep learning curve and it takes time to be a reasonably good Plutus developer, let alone mastering Plutus. Though there are a large number of professionals in the IT industry, almost all of them have their day jobs and are unlikely to find the time to research Cardano and learning opportunities. This solution provides a one stop place for Cardano content in regional languages for easy learning.\n3.

    '{"brief": "Without the supportive environment for developers, new innovations would be stalled. By supporting this challenge settings, more developers would be drawn into Cardano. There would be a bigger talent pool of developers that Catalyst projects can collaborate with and turn project concepts/Proof of concept into successful protocols which would enhance the growth of Cardano.\n\n \n\n\nGuiding questions\n\n \n\n\n\\* What are the the tools that we need to prioritize first\n\\* How do we attract developers from outside of our current community to participate in Catalyst?\n\\* What do developers want, and how do they get it from the Cardano dev ecosystem?\n\\* What would make it a developer motivated to grind through the docs and code no matter how hard it is to create an app?\n\\* What are enterprise dev managers looking for in order to be able to build out enterprise projects - either internal or commercial?\n\n \n\n\nPotential directions\n\n \n\n\n\\* Developer productivity: IDE''s, scripts to automate stuff.\n\\* Knowledge base & Documentation\n\\* Deployment, testing, and monitoring frameworks\n\\* Samples, recipes and templates\n\\* Hackathons\n\\* DEFI and tokenization\n\\* Dashboards\n\\* API''s, and oracles.\n\\* Support structures\n\\* Incentivization structures\n\n \n\n\nNotes \n\n\\* This challenge is a continuation of F8: Developer Ecosystem ($1,000,000)\n\\* This challenge is a separate challenge from Open Source Developer Ecosystem. While we are advocates of open source, we recognize that not all teams are at the point where they feel comfortable or capable of open sourcing their solutions. Some APIs may be closed source forever, but still provide an overall net positive for the Cardano ecosystem. If you are all-in on open source from day one, definitely go with the Open Source Development Ecosystem challenge (if that''s an option). We are rooting for you. We believe, however, there''s room for both at this point.\n", "importance": "Creating an awesome experience that incentives developers, will lead to increased developer adoption, productivity, and creativity.\n\n", "goal": "Cardano attracts high-calibre Developers and developers have ample resources to work on platforms that suit their interests.\n\n", "metrics": "At the end of this challenge, we will be asking ourselves: Did we manage to make it easier for developers to build on top of Cardano?\n\n  \n\n\n* Filling in gaps defined in the exploration stage.\n* Number of developers actively building on top of Cardano\n* Number of repos on Github using the tooling. (Month over month increase)\n* Reduce wait time of unanswered communications with developers to 24 hours.\n* A sense of community and conversations. Having people around to talk with.\n"}', -- extra

    '{"solution": "\\*Does this proposal fall within the scope of the challenge brief?\\*\n\n \n\n\nThis proposal falls within the scope of the challenge brief because it sets up and lays out a system whereby multiple stakeholders are benefitted.\n\n \n\n\nBenefits the environment by reducing food waste, reducing landfills, reducing land and air pollution by reducing CO2 Emissions\n\n \n\n\nBenefits poor and hungry, orphans, elders, disabled, low income housing dwellers, street people, stray animals.\n\n \n\n\nIs able to track precisely what is collected from where, and how its distributed\n\n \n\n\nProvides highly satisfying employment for the distribution teams.\n\n \n\n\n\\*How the solution relate to the challenge success (Impact)\\*\n\n \n\n\nSolution will enable rapid, systematic, lowest cost capability for food collection, segregation into what goes to which beneficiary and distribution every day and night.\n\n \n\n\n\\*Does this proposal show clearly how it will add value to the Cardano System?\\*\n\n \n\n\nThis project will add value to the Cardano Ecosystem by providing benefits to the environment, stakeholders such as restaurants, food donators and beneficaries.\n\n \n\n\nThere are various Blockchain based components here. They include\n\n \n\n\nThe NFT based system to tag each food packet received from a restaurant with an NFT and track that NFT to its beneficiary location and upto the moment of distribution.\n\n \n\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/397651\n\n \n\n\nThe NFT that is generated in the form of a photo/video of the packages being handed to the beneficiary which can be sold on the NFT marketplace like CNFT\n\n \n\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/397651\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nA new NFT marketplace whereby social causes can launch NFTs in order to generate funds through sale of unique NFTs or through minting and sale of NFTs designed to track and provide transparency and auditability to any social service or charity project\n\n \n\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/397281\n\n \n\n\nThe AI driven app which can optimize route planning, pickup and drop-off scheduling in order to reduce costs and maximize productivity of limiter resources such as vehicles and staff\n\n \n\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398297\n\n \n\n\nThe NFT based system which allows freelancers and volunteers to slot in and out of shifts, times and roles and get paid exactly for what they are doing.\n\n \n\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398295\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThe NFT based system where people can buy NFTs to support purchase of a vehicle, running costs , salaries and other costs of the food runs.\u00a0\\*( We need NFTs, DeFi, Token sales and any and all other methods to raise funds)\\*\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(this proposal)\n\n \n\n\n\\*How does the Blockchain contribute?\\*\n\n \n\n\nAt each location we will generate NFTs for each package of food. That food package would be tracked using our App/AI system to its optimal beneficiary location. Factors as to which location would be such as age of beneficiaries, can they eat this particular type of food, what time do they need food dropped off and what time would gates close for the night, Do they have facilities to refrigerate or freeze this type of food, Can this food be stored, or must it be consumed on the same day/night? These NFTs can be listed on a batch minting basis on existing NFT marketplace like CNFT until our own NFT marketplace is developed.\n\n \n\n\nAs each package is dropped off that NFT is captured by means of photo of the beneficiary receiving the food package or box of multiple items which are identified by one single NFT. This photo would be available for purchase on our NFT marketplace which would be custom built for charity/social upliftment projects. ( Separate proposal for NFT marketplace - link given here)\n\n \n\n\nA person on the blockchain can by purchasing NFTs on this marketplace can support specific families or homes / beneficiary locations who would be regular beneficiaries. IN this manner, they would be financially supporting these families.\n\n \n\n\nIdeally we would be able to convert the crypto currency into USD rather than local currency to ensure that the USD would be easily convertible and not subject to the wide fluctuations of local currency.\n\n \n\n\nThe blockchain would also contribute through the AI driven App ( Separate proposal for AI Driven App - link given here) which would be coupled with the blockchain.\n\n \n\n\nWe would also have a DeFi app developed where the profits from the app would go towards running costs and further expansion of the operation. As more restaurants come on board, more vehicles would be needed and more staff needed to handle the increase in food pickups and drop offs all within the narrow window of time where the food is fresh and consumable. There is no point if the food is delivered three hours after pickup and its not safe to consume.\n\n \n\n\nThe blockchain will also be used to run a creative way of rewarding participants in a community type way. That is whereby they will not be treated as full time employees but rewarded for the amount of time they spend on the work, or based on achievement of certain targets or workload.\n\n \n\n\nFor example, instead of paying people a monthly salary and hiring them as full time staff, there could be multiple freelancers who would come in and do the quantum of work, and get rewarded based on how many 4 hour shifts they put in. The four hour shift can apply to the lunch run or the dinner run.\n\n \n\n\nThe four hour shift would cover their work of picking up food from designated restaurants as well as ad hoc restaurants and private donors and taking it to the designated beneficiary locations.\n\n \n\n\nEach person may have a unique attendance NFT generated as they log in or clock in to work. Their work will be tracked based on time worked or targets acheived and rewards allocated.\n\n \n\n\nThis will allow volunteers from anywhere in the world to come and be part of this initiative. Perhaps young tourists as part of their holiday can spend some time volunteering on this project. While they won''t be able to drive the vehicles they would be able to handle the pickup and distribution aspects. Even locals can become freelance volunteers and earn income for participating in pickups and distributions.\n\n \n\n\nSome tourists and locals could also handle marketing aspects such as onboarding new restaurants and corporate donors, talking to prospective restaurants and corporate donors, mentoring new participants and showing them the ropes, creative work such as graphics, social media work, writing, doing posts on various social platforms, video creation for Youtube.\n\n \n\n\n\\*Benefits to Stakeholders\\*\n\n \n\n\nThe benefits to the restauranteur would be as follows\n\n \n\n\nAs a socially conscious restauranteur they would rather not throw their excess food away. As a human being with a conscience, they care about those who don''t have food to eat. That is why they are donating excess food instead of throwing it. This is why I know they will be positive about this opportunity for them to be part of a new sustainable initiative of mine. They also may not have the resources to do food runs and drop offs themselves and would rather partner with someone who would commit to doing this on a daily basis. This is what i will offer them.\n\n \n\n\nIf each restaurant who wants to join the \"Five Loaves Two Fish \" network, then they would be recognized as part of being part of this network who distributes food to the hungry and needy, through my FB page, Instagram page, Youtube channel and other media. Part of the role of the staff handling the pickup and distribution would be to capture photos and video. The restaurants are free to talk about it on their social media, other press releases and any other publicity that they want to use it for.\n\n \n\n\n\\*Benefits to the Corporate/ Charitable Foundation providing Funding\\*\n\n \n\n\nThis will add huge amounts of goodwill to your company and your own staff will be motivated that their CSR project is something with so much social value and meaning. They will be motivated hugely and productivity will rise. Media publicity will result in a huge goodwill for your company resulting in rises in share value as well as increase in shareholders and market share\n\n \n\n\n\\*Benefits to the Blockchain community\\*\n\n \n\n\nThis will add huge amounts of goodwill to your Community and your own community members will be motivated that their CSR project is something with so much social value and meaning. They will be motivated hugely and productivity will rise. Media publicity will result in a huge goodwill for your community resulting in rises in community value as well as increase in community members\n\n \n\n\n\\*Benefits to the Stake Pool Operator\\*\n\n \n\n\nThis will add huge amounts of goodwill to your Stake Pool and your own delegators will be motivated that their CSR project is something with so much social value and meaning. They will be motivated hugely and productivity will rise. Media publicity will result in a huge goodwill for your stake pool resulting in rises in coin value as well as increase in delegators. You can also use us to set off your carbon emissions and buy our carbon credits and support us that way. This in addition to supporting our work with some portion of your profits.\n\n \n\n\n\\*Food donated by individuals, families or corporates.\\*\n\n \n\n\nA person who purchases excess food and cant eat it all can choose to have the excess food which is unopened to be donated through the AI driven app and our staff will do the pickup of that food. That food would also be delivered to a beneficiary. A family who has a birthday party. wedding reception or homecoming, anniversary party. job party, or corporate event can choose to have their excess food also donated via our App. This food would also be donated to beneficiary locations after having been picked up by staff.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOur values:\n\n \n\n\nSaving good food from landfills and preventing CO2 Emissions from the food going into landfills\n\n \n\n\nWhy should good food be thrown and good people go hungry?

    '{"solution": "Leveraging one of the existing Cardano NFT Marketplaces, along with Coti''s FIAT payment integration solution and the power of a decentralised infrastructure, we propose the following preliminary solution:\n\n \n\n\nThe web2 front-end (with crypto and non-crypto payment options)\u00a0would allow people who select criteria/preferences to find recipes to cook, order the ingredients to their house, order a cooked meal, or even book a private chef, etc.\n\n \n\n\nThe AI driven user experience will be much more engaging because of the metadata rich repository of recipes and content secured on the blockchain by NFTs and monetised using smart contracts. By opening up the marketplace with APIs to other websites, partners and marketplaces, we will be able to target a wider audience of customers for our Cardano minted NFT smart contracts.\n\n \n\n\nTo detail the solution further, we have split the offering into 2 parts, B2C and B2B below.\n\n \n\n\nB2C Offerings: Guide me to cook a recipe, deliver a cooked recipe to me, cook it with me (private chef), send me the ingredients of the recipe (grocery store), build me a healthy meal plan and deliver it or guide me to cook it (Nutritionist and cloud kitchen).\n\n \n\n\nB2B Offerings: Sell me a menu for my cloud kitchen (Menu-as-a-Service), build me a virtual brand for my cloud kitchen, use produce from our farm with these recipes, franchise a restaurant with this concept, and Menu-as-A-Service for restaurants built using authenticated NFT based recipes.\n\n \n\n\nSome of the benefits of Yumchain include the following:\n\n \n\n\n1. Positive ROI on content creation investments by food professionals with the biggest share of revenue from downloads/sales of experiences going back to the owners\n2. Full ownership and transparency on revenues\n3. Instantaneous settlement of revenues (Coti/Djed will figure prominently as a partner on Yumchain)\n4. Direct marketing and engagement without intermediaries on content owners own platforms if preferred\n5. Perpetual revenue streams with options to fund charities, foundations or family office owned wallets\n6. Customised meal plan design capabilities and instant transactions between fitness/nutrition service providers, cloud kitchens and consumers\n7. Secure, immutable, permanent repository of content that cannot be de-platformed ( on a decentralise storage infrastructure for content and media)\n8. Ability to monetise and drive innovation around concepts/recipes/plans/etc for creatives and industry professionals\n9. Ability to create additional revenue streams through experience NFTs, collectibles, etc\n10. Cooking classes in the Metaverse and other educational and enriching experiences\n11. Ability to monetise existing content quickly with some chefs able to mint thousands of existing recipes and associated content\n12. Open APIs to an ecosystem of food delivery partners, cloud kitchens, grocery stores and other industry players\n"}', -- extra

There''s a growing level of media coverage on NFTs (and NFT-related woes on Ethereum) that the campaign we''re planning can take advantage of.\n\n \n\n\nChallenge KPI # 2: Number of users of these smart contracts once migrated to the Cardano ecosystem\n\n \n\n\nThere are several downstream benefits of our proposal''s approach to increasing the number of users on Cardano and usage of Cardano smart contracts:\n\n \n\n\n1. Again, respected artists bring with them followers, and these followers will be interacting with Cardano smart contracts in purchasing and listing NFTs on Cardano''s major NFT marketplaces.\n2. Our team is developing a public API where all Cardano users can utilize VeraNFT to query the origins of CNFTs and help determine their authenticity, and doing so will occassion a transaction on the Cardano blockchain.\n3. The marketing campaign we have planned will show the trust and security advantages of Cardano to all NFT artists and project owners exposed to the marketing, not just the Ethereum based artists (and artists whose work has been exploited) in our incentive program. And this perception of a safer NFT trading environment will hopefully help bring additional projects, users and smart contract transactions to Cardano.\n4. Our plan is to launch Profolio Protection and out marketing campaign as Cardano''s more dramatic scaling solutions are coming online. So our hope is that users who dabble in the Cardano ecosystem because of our campaign, end up staying because of a superior user experience and burgeoning defi and realfi ecosystems.\n"}', -- extra

Especially as \"cryptocurrency companies,\" these businesses and dApps will be compelled by prevailing financial and regulatory regimes to reduce their carbon footprint wherever possible.\n\n \n\n\nAnd even if this move towards ESG-focused staking doesn''t turn out to be mandatory, its hard to see why many enterprises would avoid it entirely: Many mission-driven pools offer returns to delegators that are on par with pools without a mission-driven component, so the downside to ESG-focused delegation doesn''t have to be burdensome. And ESG-focused staking builds good will with the customers of Cardano enterprises.\n\n \n\nOur team sees the move towards mission-driven, accountable staking for businesses as analogous to the corporate giving sector: It may not come to dominate the enterprise delegation space (which is driven primarily by ROI) but a significant percentage of enterprise delegations will be allocated to it.\n\n \n\n\nEven more importantly, we''ve outlined clear advantages that the Cardano staking ecosystem has over other blockchains when it comes to ESG-compliant staking. And if ESG is becoming as big of an issue as it appears to be, \\*these advantages and the work of our project and others like it will drive more projects to Cardano, and more growth in activity on Cardano''s mainnet and testnet.\\* \n\n \n\n\nLast, because pioneers in this STaaS niche will likely secure significant delegations for their stakepools within the next 6 - 18 months, \\*stakepools in the network we''re proposing should eventually have healthy revenues and be able to self-fund the bulk of this projects future development.\\* \n\n"}', -- extra

    '{"solution": "Our tutorials will demonstrate the advantages of blockchain, especially Cardano, by providing entrepreneurs and developers with new concepts that will help them design better economic interactions, build open-source frameworks, construct DeFi protocols, or develop tools for DAO''s.\n\nAccessible knowledge: Early stage entrepreneurs and developers can leverage Cardano to effect change and scale collaborative networks by offering introductory education materials on token economics and engineering topics.\n\n \n\n\nAlign open-source effort: Having a common language of core token engineering concepts allows different projects to understand each other and work out how they can interoperate, Leading to collaboration that improves interoperability. With many new developers and entrepreneurs coming to Cardano, the ecosystem needs ways to share knowledge about using the underlying technology. The tutorials help build an understanding of market mechanisms and token economics to help teams build better tools.\n\n \n\n\nEducation for software development: We can only imagine solutions to wicked problems using the conceptual tools at our disposal. Developing software is a knowledge and labour intensive endeavour. If DApp product managers and software developers don\u0092t know about token economics or token engineering concepts, they will design sub-par solutions. Understanding token engineering gives people knowledge and the power to solve local problems globally.\n\n \n\n\nIncentive systems generate business value: Blockchain is institutional technology designed to regulate agents'' behaviour through explicit rules and the immutable recording of interactions (transactions). Most tokens are simple, used as digital monies or unique digital property. It is like treating the automobile as a \"horseless carriage.\" More advanced incentive systems and value creation can help solve coordination and collaboration problems. Token engineering aims to provide the conceptual tools and software implementation understanding to help design these more advanced incentive systems. By introducing these ideas in an approachable and open way, we can encourage more people to think differently, putting Cardano at the forefront of the emerging discipline of token engineering.\n\n \n\n\nNew forms of governance and collaboration: Direct democratic systems don''t scale, and if we have to rely on voting\u0097 plutocratic, quadratic, approval, or one-person-one-vote\u0097 we are just reinventing a digital bureaucracy. Markets and incentive systems scale and are more decentralised. Market mechanisms can be used to implement more scalable governance in ways that develop sustainable ecosystems and enable people, companies, and DAOs to contribute back to the community.\n\n"}', -- extra

Think globally; act locally.\n\n \n\n\nWhen the platform is fully functional and a critical mass of users is reached, the intention would be to switch to targeted engagement with existing local government policy processes and electoral systems, building up from there to regional and then national level, fostering voting public understanding and trust along the way.\n\n \n\n\nThe long-term strategy is to allow communities to self-organise without explicitly needing representatives, and to stand independent candidates elected to act on the collective \u0093will of the people\u0094 until governance systems can be reformed into a coordinated, distributed democracy.\n\n \n\n\nThis is the seed for a parallel system of democracy that seeks to shift the status quo and bring about a reformation of democratic governance into one that is digitally driven, deliberative, decentralised and fit for the 21st Century.\n\n \n\n\nF8 Challenge setting voters and proposers should recognise that globally there are over 10 million not-for-profits, 3 million co-operatives, plus many millions more unincorporated groups, clubs and associations worldwide that use democratic processes to manage trillions in transactions and assets:\n\n \n\n\nhttps://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/facts-and-figures\n\n \n\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/03/2168791/28124/en/Global-NGOs-and-Charitable-Organizations-Market-Report-2020-Market-is-Expected-to-Decline-from-255-705-9-Million-in-2019-to-253-336-3-Million-in-2020-Forecast-to-2030.html\n\n \n\n\nThe Challenge Brief\n\n \n\n\nThere are currently no integrated toolkits that allow democratic organisations to function via a single sign on. While the enterprise and small business market demands are partially fulfilled by many vendors with scalable solutions, the not-for-profit sector, community groups and civil society organisations have to make do with stitching together various open source tools and paid software to try to achieve their organisational goals.\n\n \n\n\nNone of these tools make it easy for members of these organisations to collaborate and make good decisions, or provide visibility and accountability over their finances to members and stakeholders.\n\n \n\n\nThis Challenge proposal aims to establish the ground work to build this needed platform. The diagram of system components attached to the challenge brief isn''t meant to be a final design, just a pastiche to show the complexity of what could be included as the ecosystem evolves.\n\n \n\n\nGiven the nature of creating complex ecosystems on limited budgets that not-for-profits need to run, we have really decided to emphasise \"Challenge\" as explained in the following 3 requirements:\n\n \n\n\nRequirement 1 - Integration Work\n\n \n\n\nThere are 3 integration components that should be included in proposals submitted to this fund:\n\n \n\n\n\\*1) A democratic component that involves the use of the Cardano blockchain.\\* \n\n \n\n\nThis could be a dApp or app focused on voting mechanisms, ideation facilitation, consensus-building processes or tokenomics frameworks for rewards schemes, participatory budget tracking and accountability etc. However, the key requirement is that it must make use of the Cardano blockchain to be eligible.\n\n \n\n\n\\*2) Integration of at least one more democracy related app produced by a different proposal team or vendor.\\* \n\n \n\n\nThe second app could be another Cardano based dApp but there should be flexibility in this to encourage collaboration across projects and find out what difficulties exist when trying to integrate apps from different suppliers and technologies other than Cardano.\n\n \n\n\nThe integration should see the 2 apps share data or workload to implement a solution.\n\nExamples would be an ideation tool passing data to a voting system, a voting system passing the result to a payments system, an identity management system passing registered voters to the voting system, a DAO builder that verifies participation via an electoral register lookup, an AGM tool that can display the proposals via a video conference and allow votes to be collected in real time and so on. Limitless options!\n\n \n\n\n\\*3) Use of a single sign on to allow users to access features in both apps.\\*\n\nThere should be no need to hold multiple passwords or to login to different apps. It might be obvious where the boundary of a system is due to interface changes, but it should work as seamlessly as using a single app.\n\n \n\n\n\\*Stretch goals to stand out and impress voters:\\*\n\n \n\n\n1) Make use of Atala Prism as part of the single sign-on solution to handle user credentials.\n\n1a) Allow place based participation credentials for non-governmental organisations.\n\n1b) Support electoral constituency credentials for government institutions or organisations related to government administration areas.\n\n \n\n\n2) Formally collaborate and pair up with other proposal submitters to extend the range of applications that are integrated rather than duplicating applications. The perfect results would be 4 or more proposal teams delivering a suite of 8+ applications using 1 single sign on solution.\n\n \n\n\n3) Use of distributed storage and compute for hosting apps such as internetcomputer.org, IPFS, nunet.io, threefold.io etc. (There is an F8 proposal for a Cardano Decentralised Storage solution).\n\n \n\n\nRequirement 2 - Community Onboarding\n\n \n\n\nThere have been many attempts at digital democracy apps in the past but none has really managed to inspire the population at large and gained significant use.\n\n \n\n\nProposers should bring in at least 2 distinct organisations as test participants. This is to ensure the integrated tool set gets real world feed back as part of a Beta Test / User Acceptance Test. Each organisation could be a small not-for-profit, an online community such as Catalyst, or even a large cooperative if there''s a valid use case for them.\n\n \n\n\nProposers can decide if they want to incentivise this participation by including in their proposal an ADA grant to not-for-profit organisations for use of their time. They should also ensure compliance with any local tax or crypto legislation.\n\n \n\n\nGetting new democratically oriented organisations onboarded and versed in multi-signature wallet use and decentralised technology should be seen favourably by voters, so the size and reach of organisations should be assessed when voting on proposals.\n\n \n\n\n\\*Stretch goals:\\* \n\n1) Recruit partner organisations across multiple continents instead of 1 country to be able to test with groups from different cultures and languages.\n\n \n\n\n2) Again formal collaboration and pairing up with other proposal submitters would allow a wider user community to be involved in evaluating the range of applications that are integrated.\n\n \n\n\nRequirement 3 - Cost Constraints.\n\n \n\n\nInstead of developing new apps and dApps this challenge is focused on integration by using existing solutions. To add a layer of difficulty the challenge fund budget will be limited to $150,000 and the maximum proposal size will be limited to $37,500 to get a minimum of 4 integrations. More if teams can keep costs lower.\n\n \n\n\n\\*Stretch Goal\\*\n\nThe lower the proposal cost the more likely it will be accepted by the voting community as value for money does count. That said, do not sacrifice quality!\n\n \n\n\nAbout Us\n\nPanacea is an informal group of professionals collaborating together through common interests spanning emergent technology, new potentials for democracy, and new forms of decentralised organisational structure.\n\n \n\n\nOur driving force is the recognition that current socioeconomic, political and financial institutions adhere to forms of governance that are no longer fit for purpose and do not represent the best interests of the vast majority of people. Instead, they are used to wield power, exert control and concentrate wealth in the vested interest of the privileged few.\n\n \n\n\nWe have developed an approach that could stimulate the grass roots adoption of distributed governance tools and processes, which when integrated effectively with decentralised finance could eventually replace the established order with one designed to encourage cooperation and collaboration instead of competition and domination.\n\n \n\n\nThe challenge fund size is purposely kept small to produce a limited number of prototypes in F9 with further proposals planned for F10.\n\n", "importance": "Governance is failing humanity, but there exists the potential to overcome the world''s greatest challenges through digital disruption.\n\n", "goal": "A truly collaborative digital democracy ecosystem that''s easy to participate in and generates the best solutions for all involved.\n\n", "metrics": "Number of projects and initiatives engaged and participating in co-design.\n\n  \n\n\nNumber and size of partner organisations onboarded into platform trials.\n\n  \n\n\nNumber of active users brought onto platform trials.\n\n  \n\n\nExpected transactions generated by platform integration.\n\n  \n\n\nDiversity of nationalities and cultures of groups involved.\n\n"}', -- extra

    '{"solution": " \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\n\nQ. This Challenge asks:\u00a0\n\n \n\n\n\\*\"How might we make it easy and fast for dApps and other projects to expand or completely move from Ethereum to Cardano?\"\\*\n\n \n\n\n1. By building a multi-chain web3 marketplace/platform that allows EVM-based NFT creators to fractionalise at low cost, gives ADA hodlrs the oportunity to add shares in high value investment grade NFTs. Expands the group of potential investors in CNFT''s to include the other blockchain communities.\n2. High value, investment grade NFT\u0092s are priced out of the normal investor\u0092s price range. Fractionlised sharehodling is the only way to make them affordable.\n\n \n\n\nVoters might wonder: \n\n \n\n\n\\*\"How can Cardano possibly compete with the Ethereum NFT juggernaut?\"\\*\n\n \n\n\n1. The answer is classic. Don\u0092t fight them. Wrap them. Bring them into the Cardano World and fractionalise them. Make those expensive NFT''s available to a broad base of small investors\n2. Using open source technology already funded through Project Catalyst, developed by DCSpark.\n\n \n\n\nThe cost to mint 10,000 fractions of an investment grade NFT within the OpenSea platform can cost $500,000 and more. Making fractionalisng NFTs on that industry leading platform uneconomical. The cost of minting a fractional shares in NFT''s on Cardano is very low.\n\n \n\n\nQ. Why is it important?\n\n \n\n\nCreative NFT originators (artists) seek to reach the broadest possible market of collectors or investors to get they best price for their work.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nHigh value, investment grade creative NFT projects are not required to begin life (be \"minted\"\\\\*) on any particular blockchain. But, until today most are minted on EVM-based blockchains.\n\n \n\n\nCardano community collectors and investors, not ordinarily active in EVM-based blockchains, also seek opportunities to invest in high value, investment grade digital assets. Often as part of a diversified investment portfolio.\n\n \n\n\nShareHodler will\n\n \n\n\n\\* bring EVM-based creative NFTs into the Cardano ecosystem as \"wrapped\" NFTs\n\\* bring Cardano-based creative NFTs (CNFTs) into the EVM ecosystem.\n\n \n\n\nIn order to provide\n\n \n\n\n\\* originators opportunities to reach the broadest audiences for their work\n\\* Cardano investors opportunities to purchase shares in high value investment grade creative \"wrapped\" NFT''s\\\\*\\\\* created in the EVM-based ecosystem.\n\n \n\n\n\\\\* See discussion of \"minting\" below\n\n\\\\*\\\\* Effectively clones of the original NFTs moving in either direction between ecosystems.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nQ. What does success look like?\n\n \n\n\nThere is no dispute. Ethereum is the biggest player in high value, investment grade NFT collectibles. Boasting some of the most valuable collections such as BAYC and CryptoPunks.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAuction houses like Sotheby''s facilitate sale of high value NFT\u0092s, but only deliver those NFT\u0092s to Ethereum wallet addresses. Which means they only deal in EVM based creative NFTs. Read from Sotheby''s fine print.\n\n \n\n\n\"How is NFT ownership transferred?\u00a0\n\n \n\n\n\\*Sotheby\u0092s will request from the Buyer a valid ETH address that supports NFTs (ERC721 and ERC20). Sotheby\u0092s will then authorize and direct the transfer of the NFT from the seller or the seller\u0092s agent to the Buyer\u0092s wallet. Please note, exchange addresses will not be accepted for transfer of the NFT.\"\\*\n\n \n\n\nWhen Cardano creators of collectible CNFTs mature to the level of being high value, investment grade, Sharehodler will offer to hold their CNFT''s or (wrapped) wCNFTs on the ecosystem of choice. Cardano collectors will bid for and buy high value, investment grade EVM-based NFTs or less expensive fractionalised shares of those assets.\n\n \n\n\nWith that in mind, this proposal answers the simple question.\n\n \n\n\n\\*\"How can Cardano creatives ever break into the high value investment grade NFT market? Now monopolised by Ethereum\"\\*\n\n \n\n\nSuccess looks like Cardano creators and collectors/investors taking a front row seat in the high value, investment grade multi-chain NFT market.\n\n \n\n\nWhat is Minting?\n\n \n\n\nFor voters or assessors who are not seriously involved with the process of creating collectible NFT''s (as opposed to utilitiy NFT''s) some additional information maybe helpful.\n\n \n\n\n\\*\"When you decide to create an NFT, you must first \u0093mint\u0094 the digital version of your artwork. Minting an artwork refers to the act of tokenizing the artwork, i.e. uploading it to a given marketplace platform (SuperRare, Nifty Gateway, Makersplace, Foundation\u0085) and issuing a token to guarantee its authenticity. You will then have to pay \u0093gas fees\u0094 to initiate the transaction on the blockchain and publish your artwork as an NFT on a marketplace.\\* \n\n \n\n\n\\*Once you have minted a piece of artwork on a marketplace as an NFT, you should never mint it on another platform. If you ever decide to do so, note that most platforms reserve the right to delete the NFT or even ban you from their platform. However, you maintain all commercial rights to\u00a0the artwork underlying the NFT. That means you can still market your art by making prints or merch, or even license it.\\* \n\n \n\n\n\\*Collectors are not allowed to do so -\u00a0they only have the right to sell, trade or transfer the NFT.\\* \n\n \n\n\n\\*This means they can\u0092t (unless they have written authorization from the artist): mint a copy of that NFT, make people pay to view the NFT, sell any derivative object incorporating the NFT or exploit the NFT in a commercial way.\\*\n\n \n\n\n\\*This leads us to an important question: are NFTs protected by copyright? NFTs are likely not\u00a0protected by copyright, because they do not meet the basic criteria for copyright protection. They basically represent data on a blockchain, which would not constitute an original work of authorship under intellectual property law. However, the artwork that you mint may be protected by copyright. For that reason, you should never mint an artwork you didn\u0092t create yourself (or in collaboration with other artists). In the United States and Canada, copyright protection only extends to the expression of ideas, and not ideas or concepts only. This means you need to \u0093fix\u0094 your idea on a medium for it to be protected.\"\\*\n\n \n\n\nhttps://www.rennoco.com/post/nfts-minting-and-copyright-what-you-should-know-as-an-artist\n\n \n\n\n"}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "This is from the previous Fund7 candidate challenge. We are aiming to involve more team members and upgrade the proposal based on the assessments.\n\nTurkey is a bridge between Asia and Europe including increased connection with countries in Africa. It has a large and young population of more than 80M people. It is the home of one of the earliest cryptocurrency exchanges, BTCTurk, which was founded in 2013. As such, Turkish people have been some of the earliest adopters of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAccording to Triple-A research, ~2.4M of the populace own cryptocurrencies. This makes it the nation with the 19th most cryptocurrency users \\[1\\]. This however does not capture the entire picture as the growth of this number has been 10 fold in the past year \\[2\\]. This massive growth can most directly be attributed to the rising prices of cryptocurrencies and to the speedy devaluation of the Turkish Lira (around ~40% against the US Dollar in 2021).\n\nDevaluation of the currency has gotten exceedingly worse and is set to continue in the near future. The negative effects are felt throughout the country as wages tumble on a USD basis. The minimum wage is around $220 as of the time of this proposal (nearly half the working population earn min. wage), meaning any funds put to work in Turkey can get lots of involvement from the local population.\n\nDespite this growth, Cardano adoption is very low. Although there is an ADA trading community of around 2853 people just in the telegram group, there is currently no broader Cardano community. The majority of the investors in the trading group were drawn to ADA by the performance of the cryptocurrency. As a result, trader emotions like fear and greed dominate the conversation within cryptocurrency communities, resulting in misinformation about the broader Cardano community. As such, a Turkish Cardano community is sorely needed to raise awareness of the vision of Cardano beyond the token price.\n\nWe the proposers of this challenge are trying to do so and bring more qualified Turkish people into the Cardano community. However, we are just a group of three within Project Catalyst with a broader network of around 20 that are involved in cryptocurrencies in Turkey. If the real value of Cardano can be demonstrated in Turkey, this number will dramatically increase. This is especially true given that the majority of young people are interested in participating in international projects. However, they face language obstacles and lack some of the relevant competencies. Therefore more initiatives are needed to realize the potential of Turkey and to aid the global adoption of Cardano.\n\nGiven these points, what could Turkey offer the Cardano community back in return? Turkey has great potential in its qualified IT and cybersecurity personnel built thanks in part to a solid financial services sector. It also has a large pool of young, active and forward looking individuals, looking to contribute to their communities. This challenge aims to bring this potential to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nGuiding questions\n\nHow can we involve general ADA holders in project Catalyst in Turkey?\n\nHow can we increase the number of SPOs from Turkey?\n\nHow can we increase more meaningful participation from Turkey?\n\nHow can we encourage new members to utilize the tools and services available for onboarding?\n\nHow can we localize the existing materials?\n\nChallange Team\n\nCem Karaca\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ckaraca\n\n\u00d6zg\u00fcr Ya\u00baar Akyar\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ozguryasarakyar\n\n\u00c7a?kan Acarbay\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/%C3%A7a%C4%9Fkan-acarbay-b2210b136\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-turkey/.\n\n\\[2\\] https://www.paribu.com/blog/en/news/paribu-has-published-the-results-of-the-most-comprehensive-cryptocurrency-survey-cryptocurrency-use-in-turkey-has-increased-by-10-times", "importance": "The decentralisation and resilience of Cardano are based on the inclusion of different locations including those communities not involved.", "goal": "Motivated community of developers, SPOs, stakers, voters, challenge teams collaborating for the growth of Cardano from Turkey in 2023.", "metrics": "We will track and publish measurement of the challenge based on the following metrics\n\nA number of proposals under this challenge.\n\nA number of funded proposals are under this challenge.\n\nAverage CA scores on proposals.\n\nA number of accounts under on proposal under this challenge.\n\nProposals aim at achieving the success of this challenge will be measured throughout the following metrics\n\nNumber of stake pools running in Turkey,\n\nThe number of Project Catalyst proposals from Turkey,\n\nNumber of developers participating in the Cardano Developer Program from Turkey,\n\nIncreased number of educational tools about the Cardano in Turkish,\n\nIncreased awareness about the Cardano blockchain in Turkish speaking communities,\n\nThe number of roles taken in Project Catalyst as CA, general voters, challenge team members, members of the catalyst circle by Turkish individuals."}', -- extra

Although this proposal does not fit in the other specific Catalyst Challenges, we choose this broad section because it is a project that has the support of the community and could enrich the Cardano ecosystem even more.\n\nWith the increasing complexity of the queries aiming to simplify its content and the growth of the blockchain itself, enabling a better way to scale will be crucial to continuing exposing the full history of the metrics collected so far. In that context, exploring different analytical data storages for our views over Cardano DB Sync (such as ClickHouse or Bigquery) will be an important step of the work done on this proposal.\n\nIn the context of having a more scalable way to expose complex data from the Cardano blockchain, we plan to enrich our dashboard with content dedicated to DEXes which are becoming more numerous as the time this proposal is being drafted. We also plan to add more content related to NFTs and other Native Tokens, which were never properly illustrated in our dashboard.\n\nAt least, we plan to devise better solutions to get a faster feedback loop from the community towards the data we are now exposing. The goal is to provide a way for different contributors to challenge our data and propose fixes and improvements."}', -- extra

    '{"solution": "The main goal of this tool is to abstract away technological details and intricacies and instead let users focus on benefits and usage. The tool will therefore be a general solution needed by many actors mentioned by the challenge statement.\n\n \n\n\nUsability and adaptability of the PRISM platform compared to competing platforms is achieved because we deliver an easy to use tool that can be used without knowing about technical details. Easy to use tools like this, will unlock exponential growth and adoption and give non-technical users a playground for exploring DID and credentials. Being available to everyone will lift the creation of new use cases out of development labs and over to everyone else. This will be a catalyst for real-world implementations on Cardano and Atala PRISM.\n\n \n\n\nBeing so user friendly, this tool also will give large benefits to the Small Producer Problem and Last-Mile Problem, as this tool will make DID and credential maintenance achievable for non-technical personnel so they can participate in the global industrial supply chain market without becoming blockchain developers.\n\n \n\n\nThe final solution will be for Holders, Issuers and Verifiers. As can be seen in project roadmap, a mobile app for Holders and Verifiers is planned as well.\n\n \n\n\nAs a pioneer of the Atala PRISM pioneer first cohort, we have seen that the process of issuing credentials to the blockchain is very time consuming because of having to wait for a specified number of blocks to be produced by the blockchain before the operation is confirmed by Atala PRISM. Tools that do not take this into account will be unusable and will inhibit adoption. We will make sure the user will be unaware of this waiting time because of the functionality we put into the application. Users will instead get subtle notifications when an operation is confirmed. How the user is notified, is of course configurable to put the user in control.\n\n \n\n\nWhy desktop application? Why not web application or mobile app?\n\nBoth mobile and web applications have been considered and might come in the future for some of the functionality. The desktop application brings best of both alternatives while being the easiest to develop into a fully functional application. We therefore propose desktop application.\n\n \n\n\nReasons for not doing web application now: In short - decentralisation considerations. We don''t want to create a centralised web solution when a clear and better decentralised alternative is available. Having personal data stored safely on your own computer instead of in a centralised web solution, means putting the ID owner in control of their digital identity files. Web applications also need to support the load from potentially thousands of concurrent users and must be available 24/7. Decentralised desktop application is available when you need it and you work with it alone. (Publish times will of course be determined by blockchain load and congestion, but this will only affect time before receiving notifications and confirmations)\n\n \n\n\nReasons for not doing mobile app now: small screen space and need for typing text might make some of the functions we want to create painful for users without keyboards. As can be seen on the proposed timeline, we are planning to create a mobile app for verification, but full management suite is best solved with a desktop application.\n\n \n\n\nWill installation be difficult? Installation will be as easy as installing regular window applications. No development experience needed or knowledge to build executables from GitHub site. No need for running any other external programs like cardano-node. You can expect a simple \"Next\"...\"Next\"...\"Finish\" install experience.\n\n"}', -- extra

It will enable Transparency, Trackability and Auditability for every stage of payments to workers of the operation. It can also be replicated in any situation involving delivery of goods or services or any NGO or charity involving volunteers or freelancers. It can be used in businesses which involve freelancers as well as media outlets like Radio and TV stations, newspapers and magazines where people are on a roster and can swap shifts.\n\n \n\n\n\\*Does this proposal show clearly how it will add value to the Cardano System?\\*\n\n \n\n\nThis project will add value to the Cardano Ecosystem by providing benefits to the environment, stakeholders such as restaurants, food donors and beneficiaries. It will also be a model by which any organization can easily achieve Transparency, Trackability and Auditability in managing their workforce\n\n \n\n\n\\*There are various Blockchain based components here. They include\\*\n\n \n\n\nThe NFT based system will be as follows\n\n \n\n\nA Date and Time NFT. This will be created for each date and time. The time could be hourly or shift based, depending on rates paid being hourly or shift based. Let''s say they are hourly. So every hour will have a different NFT. If each shift is taken as a block then a 2 hour shift would have an NFT.\n\n \n\n\nEach worker will have a unique Worker ID NFT\n\n \n\n\nEach Role will have a Role NFT.\n\n \n\n\nThe Worker NFTs will also be linked to Location Services to identify whether a person is in the right location to be picked up by the vehicle which is supposed to pick him up.\n\n \n\n\nThe Role NFT corresponds to every role. So the roles for a shift could include\n\n \n\n\n1 team of driver and loader. Transportation NFT\n\n \n\n\n1 Admin Person Admin NFT\n\n \n\n\n1 Marketing Person Marketing NFT\n\n \n\n\n1 Social Media and Content Creation Person Social Media NFT\n\n \n\n\nPeople are able to pick up shifts by connecting through the system their ID NFT to the role NFT and the Date/Time NFT. They will be able to swap by handing off the role NFT and a Date/Time NFT away from their own NFT to the other person\u0092s ID NFT. In other words the system will remove the Role NFT and Date /TIme NFT from the Giver\u0092s ID NFT and allocate it to the Receiver\u0092s ID NFT. There would be a smart contract connected to each of these NFTs.\n\n \n\n\nSo lets say the Marketing NFT is having a rate of 20$ per hour. If someone is doing the work of marketing for 3 hours on a day, his ID NFT will be tied to the Marketing NFT and the Day/Time NFT for marketing. The Day/TIme NFT for Transportation will be on a different schedule. Therefore the rates for Transportation work may be different from rates for Marketing work. So the Transportation NFT may have a rate of 20$ per 2 hour shift. So if a person has worked 4 shifts for a week, the system will recognize that his ID NFT was tied to the Transportation NFT on 4 separate Date/Time NFTs..\n\n \n\n\nThe smart contracts would have the rates applicable for the respective roles and calculate their earnings accordingly.\n\n \n\n\nAlso the system would ensure that one person does not hold more than one Role NFT for the same Date/Time NFT. In other words a person cannot be working as a Transport person as well as Marketing person within the same Date/Time. The Role NFTs and Day/TIme NFTs for a particular Role can only be held by one person at a time.\n\n \n\n\nThe system will also allow freelancers or volunteers to take photos of themselves doing the job using the app. The app will certify these photos that these freelancers or volunteers ( certified by name NFT) were in fact carrying out the work they had said they were doing. The Freelancers or Volunteers can then sell this on an NFT marketplace. The revenue would be shared on a 85% to freelancer and 15% back to Five Loaves Two Fish.\n\n \n\n\n\\*How would I measure the impact of this project?\\*\n\n \n\n\nNumber of restaurants onboarded\n\n \n\n\nNumber of food packs collected per restaurant per day\n\n \n\n\nNumber of food packs distributed per day\n\n \n\n\nNumber of NFTs handled of each role by freelancers or volunteers\n\n \n\n\nNumber of NFTs handled on each day by freelancers or volunteers\n\n \n\n\nNumber of Freelancers or volunteers working\n\n \n\n\n\\*How will the outcomes of your project be communicated or marketed once completed?\\*\n\n \n\n\nOnce we are ready to onboard restaurants we would go to the Colombo City Restaurants Collective who have 57 restaurants ( https://web.facebook.com/ccrcsl/?\\\\_rdc=1&\\\\_rdr)) . We have already spoken to them and many of them are keen to join the effort since they also are able to be seen as socially and environmentally conscious restaurants, and thereby increase their goodwill among customers.\n\n \n\n\nAt the same time we would quickly onboard several beneficiaries we have already identified.\n\n \n\n\nWe will also have massive social media and mass media campaigns encouraging people to make use of the system to donate their excess food from parties, weddings, corporate functions etc\n\n \n\n\nWe will offer opportunities for school leavers, school goers seeking part time jobs, university students seeking freelance employment when they dont have classes, foreign volunteers who come from overseas to take part in charitable projects.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\\*Can this project be scaled to address future challenges?\\*\n\n \n\n\nThe proposal can be scaled to address future challenges by bringing on board more restaurants, and more corporate donors, households. It can also scale up by increasing the frequency of delivery from once a week to daily. It can also bring in more freelancers or volunteers who may come from abroad and be part of this operation\n\n \n\n\n\\*Will the project have a positive impact on the Cardano system?\\*\n\n \n\n\nThis project will have a positive impact on the Cardano system because it will enable any business to effectively manage their freelancers and volunteers in a cost effective manner, with minimal or no disruption to the schedule .\n\n"}', -- extra

    '{"solution": "How does this proposal align with the Cardano vision, and the Accelerating Decentralized Identity Challenge criteria?\n\n \n\n\nFirst let\u0092s imagine a future state of Study Buddy 3.0 as a vast network of individuals who have been interacting in a distributed but highly structured way. These individuals are demonstrably accomplishing their individual learning goals in three-person groups. They connect with others in the network to continue learning with the same or with different groups. Through the NFT-based validation process and a simple keyword search, individuals find and interact with others of greater and lesser knowledge in similar subject areas. This network thus becomes the biggest and most distributed school on the planet.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nSuch a network will support the Challenge criteria both in general and specific terms.\n\n\u00a0\n\nGeneral Criteria\n\n \n\n\nLike the Challenge itself, we draw inspiration from the principles from \u0091patterns of commoning.\u0092 Realizing our vision of a distributed/decentralized network of connected learners will be an example of \u0093 innovation \u0085 linking communities with shared interests under these principles\u0094 in a truly embodied and tangible way, concretely linking individuals precisely through their shared interests, and bringing this expanded knowledge back to their communities.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nParaphrasing patterns of commoning as expressed by David Harvey, the Study Buddy 3.0 network of learning groups will\u00a0\u0093establish a social relation with a common whose uses are either exclusive to a social group or partially or fully open to all and sundry.\u0094 The distributed Study Buddy network will not belong to any one organization, but rather will truly be a \u0093common,\u0094 a space and resource shared by all.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nThe Study Buddy 3.0 model remains \u0093off-limits to the logic of [the] market\u0094 in that the learning is defined by the learners themselves.\u00a0Not bound to but able to support institutional curricula.\n\n \n\n\nHarvey, David (2012). Rebel cities : from the right to the city to the urban revolution. New York: Verso. p. 73. ISBN 978-1-84467-882-2. OCLC 767564397.\n\n \n\n\nSpecific Criteria\n\n \n\n\n\\*High-value alternative credentials\\*\n\nAgain let\u0092s imagine the network in its developed state. Individuals have created in NFT form very granular pieces of evidence of their competencies. These individuals then share this evidence as they wish. Mostly we assume the main use will be to accompany more traditional i.e. certificate or degree-based evidence of learning issued by learning institutions.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nThe Study Buddy 3.0 NFT-based evidence will be a high-value credential, by virtue of its solid validation, focused granularity, versatility, shareability, and freshness. This kind of credential will be an\u00a0alternative to accredited education and career paths. As individuals in the community create a body of work in the form of NFTs that show and tell their competencies, they\u0092ll be able to maintain their reputation as a skilled employee, laborer, consultant, mentor, teacher, etc.\n\n \n\n\n\\*Self-Governing\\*\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe are already considering mechanisms for challenging given validations. Since the system is self-selected and self-validating, these mechanisms will be a way for the community to self-heal and self-monitor for bad actors, harmful actions, or bad outcomes.\n\n \n\n\n\\*Creating and Maintaining Community\\*\n\n \n\n\nThe network of individuals creating these credentials will be a self-governing emergent community, all sharing the common resources of a peer-validated ecosystem. This will be a real-world implementation on Cardano with a virtually unlimited scope.\n\n \n\n\nThrough the Study Buddy 3.0 structure, learners will be able to demonstrate their competencies directly to those interested e.g. employers, thus being able to bypass institutions. As such these individuals will be able to negotiate as a community for better terms to have the values of their competencies recognized, distributed, and sold with value intact.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nAnd finally, since the Study Buddy 3.0 structure will apply to virtually any kind of learning at any level, it will constitute an exciting discovery of repeatable patterns in a huge number of potential specific use-cases.\n\n \n\n\nAll in all, Study Buddy 3.0 presents a model for educational interaction and assessment that supports and extends the principles of Cardano and of the Accelerating Decentralized Identity Challenge in tangible ways.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\n"}', -- extra

However, off-chain code requires non-trivial understanding of Haskell, such as Monad [1] and type families [2], which means weeks, if not months, of learning for new Haskell developers to fully master. Additionally, off-chain code is usually more complex and longer than on-chain code, because it is responsible for handling all use cases and scenarios for users to interact with Plutus scripts. Hence, for developers without prior Haskell experience, it will take a significant amount of time to learn, write, and debug off-chain code. A supporting evidence is that Plutus pioneer program is a ten-week long program, and there is a week dedicated to Monad [3]. The steep learning curve of Haskell does not only affect development speed, but also discourages new developers who want to build on Cardano, and could potentially slow down developer adoption.\n\n \n\n\nWhat if we provide developers with a library by which they can write all off-chain code in one of the most popular programming languages, Python? Instead of spending time on learning advanced Haskell, developers can write simple Python code, and building dApps suddenly becomes much easier! Thousands of Python developers will be able to quickly learn, understand, and build Cardano dApps, not in weeks or months, but in days.\n\n \n\n\nSome people might ask if using Python will jeopardize the security of Cardano''s smart contract in a certain degree. The short answer is no. As a reminder, on-chain code will still need to be written in Haskell/Plutus, and only the gigantic off-chain code will be written in Python. The main security of Plutus script is coming from its on-chain part, which basically determines Who, How, and When could the locked fund be spent. This part is intact and therefore secured. Only the off-chain part will be written in Python. A resulting benefit of such combination is that developers can enjoy the security brought by Plutus and the easiness and simplicity brought by Python.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n[1] Monad:\u00a0https://wiki.haskell.org/All\\\\_About\\\\_Monads\n\n \n\n\n[2] Type families:\u00a0https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/Type\\\\_families\n\n \n\n\n[3] Plutus-pioneer-program, Monad: https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program#lecture-4\n\n"}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "Web2 held a promise of a more participatory, fun and user-driven internet. Yet it was soon co-opted by powerful corporations.\n\n \n\n\nWeb3 holds the same promise and our daily interactions happen more and more online. Web3 just goes one step further, promising true decentralization and control of your own data. As we engage with one another, and increasingly with machines, we can become active creators of a truly decentralized Internet of Value. One day, probably sooner than expected, augmented reality interfaces enable us to\u00a0morph the user experience into a mesh of Metaverses.\n\n \n\n\nUnfortunately, if this is not done with the highest integrity, transparency and openness in mind, Web3 will face the same faith as Web2. It will be annexed by power-hungry mega enterprises. Any technology can be used with good or bad intentions, and there will be unimagined consequences. At its worst, Metaverse can become a dystopian nightmare that we can''t wake up from.\n\n \n\n\nTherefore, when developing the building blocks of the metaverse and services on it, solid information security and decentralized self-sovereign identity become necessities.\u00a0Blockchain solutions need to be developed in collaboration with government, nonprofits, educational institutions and business.\n\n \n\n\nSummary (from PwC):\n\n\\* Don''t believe the hype: the metaverse is an evolution, not a revolution. And it''s one that business leaders should not ignore.\n\\* The metaverse may profoundly change how businesses and consumers interact with products, services and each other.\n\\* Key metaverse concepts, including digital economy innovations such as cryptocurrencies,\u00a0are business-relevant today.\n\\* Risks are real too: new technologies require new strategies and new methods to build trust.\n\\* Measured actions can allow business leaders to familiarize themselves with the six most important metaverse concepts and explore lower-risk use cases.\n\n \n\n\nThe building blocks of the metaverse:\n\n \n\n\nEconomy\n\nCryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other blockchain-based digital currencies, assets and exchanges will likely underpin value exchange across the metaverse. Further innovation will be needed as governments, companies and new, digital-only organizations work to build trusted digital monetary systems, offer new data monetization propositions and conduct lending, payments, real estate investment and more in the metaverse. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) \u0097 with voluntarily agreed-upon rules enforced by a computer program that runs on a blockchain \u0097 will likely play important roles.\n\n \n\n\nInteroperability\n\nA true metaverse requires seamless interoperability among users and platforms, based on web 3.0 and still-to-be-determined standards. While this interoperability will offer new possibilities to reach and understand customers, it will also raise new challenges for gathering and protecting data, and for cybersecurity and privacy. It may also undermine business strategies built around keeping users and their data in a given platform. Competitive advantage may shift to those companies that offer (through hardware or software) trusted ways for users to enter the metaverse.\n\n \n\n\nGovernance\n\nThe metaverse will need rules of engagement for users, rules for how the metaverse itself can change over time and enforcement mechanisms, including for tax collection, data governance and regulatory compliance. Early movers may be able to help set these rules. Security will be paramount, as a new, decentralized digital world may offer malicious actors a new world of entry points for attack. Authenticity \u0097 and trust more broadly \u0097 should also be front and center, to reduce the disinformation that has often plagued the internet.\n\n \n\n\nIdentity\n\nIn the internet today, identity is often linked to platforms. It may be true, pseudonymous or anonymous. The metaverse, decentralized and interconnected, will need trusted digital identities \u0097 for people, assets and organizations \u0097 that port across platforms. Companies active in digital identity now may both help set the metaverse\u0092s standards and be able to offer a necessary service. Digital identities may also be central to permitted data collection and data governance in a decentralized environment.\n\n \n\n\nExperience\n\nA shared, persistent and immersive 3D digital world will offer unique experiences, based on its own aesthetics \u0097 beliefs, ideals and tastes as expressed in individual choices. Some trends for user experience are already becoming clear, in games and VR / AR environments. Companies that create trusted metaverse experiences and protect privacy rights may win consumer loyalty, while those that stay on top of metaverse trends may be well placed to forecast consumer preferences and behavior.\n\n \n\n\nPersistence\n\nA true metaverse should reflect in real time the changes made in it by different participants, entering and leaving it in different ways, in different places, at different times. When you take your metaverse headset off, the metaverse and other participants will continue their activities uninterrupted, with (for example) smart contracts enforcing agreements and trading assets. This persistence will likely require a new approach to digital assets and activities, including services and applications that are portable, dynamically configurable and extensible.\n\n \n\n\nSource: Demystifying the Metaverse\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAlignment with Fund9 strategic goals\n\nFund9 Challenge Setting proposals have to meet one or more of these attributes:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\* \\*Prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem.\\*\n\\* Because it''s so trendy, a metaverse-related challenge can help bring people from outside of Cardano ecosystem into Catalyst.\n\\* \\*Turn Cardano into an open source project.\\*\n\\* The centralized metaverse model advanced by large corporations is a threat to all things open source. This challenge setting proposal helps Cardano become a notable player in the Open Metaverse.\n\\* \\*Accelerate the growth and evolution of developer & app ecosystem.\\*\n\\* It is safe to assume that metaverse-related initiatives will be exciting for the growth of developer ecosystem and dApp builders, too.\n\n \n\n\nChallenge Team\n\nYou are welcome to join the challenge team. Just connect with the main proposer Tomi Astikainen. He is a Kickstarter, Connector and Storyteller who helps in different facets of Project Catalyst. He is in various Challenge Teams, a Veteran Community Advisor and an active community member since Fund3.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/tomiastikainen/\n\n", "importance": "To keep the metaverse solutions open and transparent, they should be developed with the highest integrity, honesty and openness in mind.\n\n", "goal": "Cardano should be recognized as one of the most viable options to create trustworthy solutions for the increasingly digitalized society.\n\n", "metrics": "Although for most the word \u0093metaverse\u0094 refers to a parallel digital reality, it''s actually a sliding scale from a fully analog world to a fully digital one. An open metaverse solution doesn''t have to be a fully immersive experience. All innovations that augment the analog experience with trustworthy digital solutions matter. Whether you label it VR, AR, XR or Metaverse solution doesn''t matter so much, as long as it takes us towards a safe, transparent and trustworthy Open Metaverse.\n\n"}', -- extra

Increase signups to Cardano ideascale as we aim to get more people to participate in the Cardano Catalyst Project. Target at least 5 new proposals per workshop. This equates to at lease 20 proposals from us executing and delivering on this idea.\n2. Increase attendance at townhall sessions as more people will be aware of Cardano and Catalyst. During our 4 planned session, we aim to encourage at least 100 people to join the town halls.\n3. We will refer our community members to the Catalyst School sessions so that they can be guided through the Catalyst innovation process\n4. We will host weekly Swarm ATH sessions in Month 3 so that attendees of our workshop can still have a reason for joining the town hall session and still have a place to ask further questions that they may have\n5.

    '{"solution": "The Challenge setting explicitly mentions how Cardano sets itself apart through its rigorous research and strives to do things correctly. It is hopefully clear from our proposed solution and the approach taken with the BlockCarbon foundation and standard that we thrive to take an inclusive, rigorous approach and create a carbon market that is distinct from yield-seeking, speculative DeFi and instead focused on fundamental price discovery and long-term appreciation of emission costs. We are targeting the highest possible levels of certification. This would allow a completely new and uncorrelated asset class with enormous growth potential over decades to emerge and critically to get built on Cardano - attracting new users and diversifying the user-base and helping grow adoptions among many corporate and individual users currently not on the blockchain.\n\n \n\n\nProof-of-Work blockchains have created much controversy among climate activists using blockchain technology and it is important to build momentum on Cardano with all its benefits over Ethereum to address the challenge.\n\nhttps://www.ecowatch.com/wwf-nft-controversy-climate-impact.html\n\n"}', -- extra

Since the home market is so small, and the awareness of world issues is so high, Finns are used to coming up with \"born global\" solutions.\n\n \n\n\nTo harness this power of highly educated and networked knowledge workers, and to create those impactful and relevant blockchain solutions, there needs to be a solid innovation process and a dedicated group of capable facilitators.\n\n \n\n\nSince 2017 Blockchain Forum Finland (nonprofit) and Helsinki Blockchain Center (for-profit) have done the groundwork in Finland. Now we, the enthusiastic Catalyst members, step in to connect all this to the global Cardano network.

For Cardano to succeed in Ethiopia, we need to go beyond the capital, Addis Ababa, and the federal government, to where over 90% of the population lives.\n\n \n\n\nEthiopia has one of the oldest religious communities who need to upgrade their organizational and administrative structure to the realities of the 22nd century.

Tracking membership and resources. \n\n \n\n\nEthiopia has community organizations such as Iddirs that support 90% of the population in their time of need when the government is too weak to deliver.

    '{"solution": "By using consenz in the process of creating bills and proposals for local, state, national and even multi-national institutions we will be able to improve the chances of those bills and proposals to get the needed support and been approved because of the following:\n\n \n\n\n1. Reduce potential objections: Incorporating a wide number of participants from diverse range of populations and communities in the drafting of proposed legislation from the start of the process will increase the chances that the needs and concerns of those communities will be taken into consideration. This will reduce the risk of discovering in retrospect that a proposed bill may harm potential allies and raises objections that can jeopardize it''s chance to be approved.\n2. Create cross political parties coalitions: Many good legislations proposals are rejected even though they can get a wide support because of automatic objections from some political parties and representatives that are the rivals of the legislation proposers. By using consenz in the process we can invite people from different political parties and ideologies to cooperate and create coalitions that overcome these automatics divisions.\n3. Involve professional and non-professional participators: One of the main features of the crypto eco-system is the potential to break down the current structure of hierarchy that give unfair advantage to some professional groups. In crypto everyone can be a banker, a broker, a trader, a money maker, a policy shaper. While this is good for defi and DAOs, lobbying and legislation require a different approach as it needs cooperation from the legacy institutions, politicians and regulators. Using consenz platform in legislation and lobbying process will allow to bring together both professional participants as lawyers, politicians, lobbyist and policy experts, and the non-professional participants from the wide crypto communities to discuss, create agreements and produce drafts and bills in a trustworthy manner, while keeping it at the highest professional level without alienating the general public from the process.\n"}', -- extra

Live auctions are held in these showcase rooms with human auctioneers, creating a fun, safe, exciting meeting place where an NFT artist can entertain their fans while enticing them in real-time to buy their latest works.\n\nOn the flips ide the NFT Viewer worlds act as custom \"viewing rooms\" that ensure that only the NFT owner gets to experience the custom content the NFT artist embedded in their purchase. However the NFT owner can also grant viewing rights to any friends or family members they choose. NFT3D Live uses advanced security features to ensure that only those people whose public addresses are whitelisted for access, can view the custom NFT content. Finally the NFT3D Live smart contract supports derivative commissions, so fans can earn profits when they sell an artist''s NFTs, if the artist grants them that right.\n\n(Please see the white paper and pitch deck in the Resources section for further details including technical details on the technology involved.)\n\nAwards\n\nNeo3D Live was a winner in the SocialFi (social finance) category of the recent Metathon Hackathon held by the Metaverse Alliance.

    '{"solution": "As there are more and more ways to express creativity, publish works, and claim authorship through decentralized mediums and platforms on the internet, a globally recognized model does not exist. While corporate mainstream possibilities exist under major recording businesses and labels where copyright can be claimed, this does not represent independent artists well. Independent publishers can still claim authorship and ownership of materials, but the process is often expensive and difficult to prove without an overseer.\n\nAs a result, there are often problems in claiming and proving originality in works. In order to meet the demands of existing copyright claims, and provide ownership and authorship rights, a verification process that deploys blockchain technology and issues certificates on the blockchain is the desired solution provided by POCRE. Identifying all the parties involved in the process and appeasing all the ownership and creative works by each contributor is a central component of our blockchain system.\n\n \n\n\nThe adoption of blockchain in the field of copyright is not new even if not globally adopted. For example, Algorand is adopted by SIAE (the official Italian copyright collecting agency, https://www.siae.it ) to store the copyright as a \u0093simple\u0094 immutable record store of the author in the \"traditional\" way. However, co-creation ownership, real-time claiming and litigation processes are not managed.\n\nPOCRE is innovative in the process but also only possible because internally implemented on a novel layer 2 solution adopting Cardano HYDRA https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/hydrafast-isomorphic-state-channels/\u00a0https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/02/03/implementing-hydra-heads-the-first-step-towards-the-full-hydra-vision/ . In POCRE the transition data (claiming and litigation) are immutable but not permanent. Only at the end of the N possible transitions (for N coauthors) the final block, containing all the elected co-authors, is permanently and immutably stored on the layer 1 chain. In the \"use case workflow\" attached is it possible to see how layer 2 is used.\n\n \n\n\nBased on the usage and adoption, currently, there appear to be no barriers to scalability thanks to HYDRA. POCRE is fully decentralized and on-chain thanks to \"Star-Shaped Head Network\" https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc/blob/abailly-iohk/star-shaped-network/docs/topologies/star-shaped.md a new protocol (in development) of Hydra. Because of that, there is no need for third-party custodianship. \n\nWhen comparing it to other similar style products like shout4\u00a0https://www.shout4.com - where authors are offered recognition for their work inside a centralized platform that can guarantee and validate recognition only inside itself - POCRE goes beyond traditional mechanisms by using a global blockchain.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFINANCIAL Key Performance Indicator (KPI)\n\n\u0095 Revenue growth\n\nNew types of economic opportunities derive from the\u00a0managing and supporting of Hydra heads.\n\n\u0095 Profit margin\n\nEvery time the (co)creator claim an opera (portion of) a micro-pay for the network is required, in this way the ecosystem is sustainable and incentivised.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSOCIAL KPI:\n\n\u0095 SDG Goals https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable\\\\_Development\\\\_Goals\n\nGoal 10. Reduce inequality within and among countries\n\nSDG Subgoals https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10\n\n10.2 By 2030, empower and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status\n\n10.2.1 Proportion of people living below 50 per cent of median income, by sex, age and persons with disabilities\n\n \n\n\n\u0095 Socio-economic benefits\n\nBeing globally decentralized, the POCRE solution advances the socio-economic benefits for creators, producers, and consumers alike, outside any authority and autoregulated by the actors themself.\n\nBeing fully on-chain and without any third-party custodianship, POCRE is fully autonomous, sustainable and anti-censorship. \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHOW DO GET PEOPLE TO ADOPT THE SOLUTION\n\nWe will build a website (useful also for tracking the progress of the development) where users can play with a demo account.\n\nWhen the solution is stable and solid, we can start to do partnerships with authoring tools like www.mash-up.app (focused on editing and publishing songs).\n\nAnother partnership can be done with potential \"competitors\" like www.soundreef.com where we have a few connections (but not yet business).\n\n"}', -- extra

    '{"solution": "Why this is important and relevant to the challenge:\n\n \n\n\nWealth is meaningless without the health to enjoy it. People unknowingly bathe in, cook with, and consume contaminated water in both developing world countries and wealthy nations. Just as important as registering a property for financial capital is accurately reporting water quality in homes and communities. We must protect our human and social capital as we work to build our economic wealth.\n\n \n\n\nEven in the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency, charged with overseeing the Safe Drinking Water Act, is \u0093overburdened, understaffed, and broke.\u0094 It is well documented that there is water contamination in over 10,000 communities in the United States, yet the people affected are mostly unaware until it is too late. In 2015, we learned that over 100,000 people were exposed to lead in the drinking water in Flint, Michigan. Thousands of Marines, their families, and civilians were exposed to poison in the water at the Camp Lejeune Marine Corps base in North Carolina between 1950 and 1985. If this is the case in the United States, how much worse is it in the developing world? People cannot rely on centralized authorities and bureaucracies to protect their water.\n\n \n\n\nOur vision:\n\n \n\n\nThe goal of CLEAN is to decentralize the process of collecting samples for water quality testing. Doing so will move the collection of water samples for testing from the central municipal water treatment facilities to where people consume water, in their homes, schools, businesses, and communities.\n\n \n\n\nReliable water quality data based on samples collected closer to where people consume the water is what we are aiming to achieve. Our goal is to collect water samples in the locations where they matter most, test those samples for contaminants, and publish that data to the blockchain in a way that verifies and substantiates previous samples, thereby creating trustworthiness through corroboration. As Shannon Vallor wrote in her book Technology And The Virtues, \"the future flourishing of humanity depends more than it ever has on our ability to obtain, verify, and share reliable information concerning problems such as global climate change; infectious disease and public health; threats to air and water supplies...\" The CLEAN decentralized water quality platform will help to do just that.\n\n \n\n\nProject activities\n\n \n\n\n1. Sourcing low-cost field testing kits and equipment and building a network of 3rd party commercial and university laboratories that can perform water contaminate testing.\n2. Organizing a community of volunteer water quality monitors.\n3. Building and maintaining a database of environmental contaminants.\n4. Developing an educational program and training materials about water quality.\n5. Designing a simple to use smartphone app that will utilize GPS and Atala PRISM DID integration to verify the user''s identity and the location of the water sample being collected. The app will facilitate the saving of data to the blockchain using image recognition and manual data entry.\n6. Developing a methodology of data corroboration based on near neighbor results using a proof-of-fact methodology. We are looking closely at the Orcfax solution (fund 6) and evaluating other \u0093trust but verify\u0094 methodologies.\n7. The creation and registration of a DAO. The management and administration of CLEAN will evolve into a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). The CLEAN DAO facilitate the governance of the project and the community.\n8. The minting of a Cardano native token to be used to reward water sample collection and testing and which could be used to purchase water testing kits, equipment, materials, and filtration devices.\n9. The operation of a stake pool where the margin rewards will be used to fund the ongoing operations of the project.\n\n \n\n\nAn Understanding of the Mystery of Capital\n\n \n\n\nIn preparation for participating in this challenge, we studied the writings of Hernando de Soto. Through that, we learned of the importance of provable ownership and the need for legal ownership rights that would allow assets to become capital. We see the need for systems and processes to transform property into capital. One component of such systems will let people see if any competing claims or obstacles block the potential value, such as liens and other encumbrances. However, other issues could severely impact the value of a property, such as contamination of the groundwater or the soil. We believe our solution would go hand in hand with a property system allowing people access to data on potential contamination issues with properties that could affect the property value and more importantly the people\u0092s health.\n\n \n\n\nAtala PRISM Integration\n\n \n\n\nWe have reviewed the IOHK/EMURGO Atala PRISM solutions and use-cases. We believe that integrating our solution with Atala PRISM would allow us to create a reputation component that would promote credibility and legitimacy of the data collected and published on our platform and help to grow the Atala PRISM DID user base.\n\n \n\n\nWe are enrolled in the Atala PRISM Pioneer program where we are learning about the SDK, the ecosystem, DIDs, governance frameworks, and issuing and verifying credentials.\n\n \n\n\nWe see the following immediate use cases for Atala PRISM and CLEAN:\n\n \n\n\n1. Digital id and authentication service for the platform.\n2. Initial onboarding\n3. Ongoing authentication\n4. Water quality certification for businesses, schools, properties, etc.\n5. This could serve like the health certificate that a restaurant receives\n6. Proof of environmental training certification for water quality monitors\n7. Individuals providing water quality testing services would be able to show proof of certification.\n"}', -- extra

In this way, it is not tied to a single server owner or \"domain.\"\n\n \n\n\nContent addressing gives us precisely the kind of links we need. You no longer get to choose the keys. Instead, the keys are derived directly from the values stored using a deterministic function that generates the same key for the same content.\n\n \n\n\nWhen your data is stored on IPFS, users can fetch it from any IPFS node with a copy, making data transfers more efficient and reducing the load on any single server.

    '{"solution": "Our solution is a decentralized eLearning platform that aims to support dev ecosystem adoption and increase collaborative contributions through\u00a0Decentralized eLearning combined with an On-Chain Resume that encourages experts to collaborate and work with new developers through mentors and mentee teams. Together they can tackle development bounties and earn, not only money but also project and team leadership credentials. Whether through earning bounties or via building their On-Chain Resume everyone will be able to build their financial freedom, collaborate, and foster the adoption of Cardano blockchain technology by the broader developer community. Our On-Chain Resume will be completely open-source to accelerate Decentralized Identity and Decentralized Networking with ATALA Prism partnership.\n\n \n\n\nWith our No-code-setup Collaborative Cloud IDE that supports over 60 coding languages and frameworks but also Haskell, Plutus, and Marlowe, any new Cardano developers can pretty much say goodbye to these problems that they face when trying to set up their dev environments: \"The hardest part of setting up the Plutus development environment is the current docs are not updated. You usually need to go dig a little deeper for some information. The repository they want us to clone and the terminal commands you have to run are outdated in the docs. The easiest environment to set Plutus upon would be using a Linux OS. It requires fewer steps than the others and is actually pretty intuitive. When you are using a Windows machine you would install WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux) and develop from there. There can be a lot of problems if you are using macOS with Apple silicon. You typically have to do more extra things than if you were to use macOS with the old intel chips because some tools are still not supported yet.\" - Snapbrillia Web3 Engineer\n\n \n\n\nThis also allows new developers to quickly and effectively join more development projects and build their Practical On-Chain Resume while also building the open web and growing the Cardano network and expanding its network effect in the broader dev ecosystem. [5]\n\n \n\n\nCreating feedback loops is also important to help mentors improve their craft and propagate the network effect. We believe that many early Cardano adopters can quickly learn how to improve their craft from observing other mentors and with peer-mentor feedback. Like with pair programming, two people can more effectively work together not only to train mentees but also amplify each other to become effective evangelists of Cardano. We already considered this as part of the incentive loop between mentors and mentors. The solution is to allow multiple mentors to participate in learning workshops, hackathons, or bounty teams as supporters and observers with the goal of providing constructive mentor peer review and feedback while honing their art of mentoring. [6]\n\n \n\n\nIf we can execute well to build this eLearning platform, the Cardano dev community will immensely benefit from the eLearning market''s massive growth to become a $1 Trillion industry by 2027 with 21.7% CARG. [7] Better access to opportunities, funding, and learning bring developers and entrepreneurs together to co-create.\n\n \n\n\nPlease see evidence for how implicit mentorship and industry expert involvement boosts efforts and the impact of the dev community and open source development.

    '{"solution": "The problem of Challenge\n\n \n\n\nCardano has a strong YouTube community, but obviously, YouTube is not everything and it''s not received well in many perspectives.\n\n \n\n\nSome people also use Youtube as a communication channel to scam their project, because nobody or institution fact-checks their information (for example https://www.cbsnews.com/news/youtube-twitter-bitcoin-scam-problems-alleged/))\n\n \n\n\nIn Vietnam, recently we see a lot of scam projects (https://vnexpress.net/mot-so-game-blockchain-viet-bi-to-lua-dao-4415913.html) and many people lost their money. The main reason is many Vietnamese investors do not have reliable reference sources before making decisions. Almost new projects\u00a0also use Youtube to deliver information and knowledge about Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (including Cardano) to the community. As talked above, much misinformation or fake news is transferred from Youtube.\n\n \n\n\nBy the way, we also found that:\n\n \n\n\n\\* We have very few market reports about Cryptocurrency Market and don\u0092t have any professional reports about Cardano. So the newbie who wants to join this market does not have an overall and reliable reference to get knowledge, and it may affect the decision to invest in crypto.\n\\* Information about Blockchain and Cryptocurrency in the local public medium (newspapers, magazine,\u0085) in Vietnam is very little and almost the topic is talked about Bitcoin. And rare information of Cardano and ADA is displayed in these channels too.\n\n \n\n\nHow our proposal can solve this problem\n\n \n\n\nIn order to make Cardano''s information reliable, we will build a summary report using secondary data, analyze the Carnado market in Vietnam, and do a survey by descriptive statistics method.\n\n \n\n\nFrom reporting, we deploy and develop communication content in various forms from reporting, summarizing information, and conveying it vividly, quickly reaching general readers and the community of virtual currency investors, especially the ADA.\n\n \n\n\nAfter having a report, we will publish it on mass media to transmit information from official channels, reaching a broad audience.\n\n \n\n\nOne of the reasons we choose mass media (or local public medium) to publish this report is that in Vietnam, cryptocurrency is illegal. Not many writers/journalists know about Blockchain and Cryptocurrency in general, particularly Cardano and ADA. But let''s make a report with professional methodology and analyze it to give their user trust information and some fee to publish this report. It will be welcome, and many Cardano Community has good knowledge in investing decisions.\n\n \n\n\nTo make this report explore more people, we will:\n\n \n\n\n\\* Contact to admin of the big crypto community in Vietnam to ask to share this report\n\\* Seeding on social media to spreads directly to the ADA investor community.\n\\* Used as an official document to report at Cardano events in the Vietnam market\n\n \n\n\nOur vision for this report\n\n \n\n\nOn the other hand, if we make a professional report, a lot of Vietnamese have knowledge (or awareness) about Cardano and they will see Cardano as a professional project and they will hold more ADA and also start-up projects with Cardano and Catalyst.\n\n \n\n\nIn the future, other people in the world can use the methodology of our report to implement in their market and publish it in their public medium.\n\n \n\n\nIn Vietnam, if we have enough resources, we can make it each quarterly (or Monthly) to give our Cardano Community have an excellent address to read information.\n\n \n\n\nIf our market report (Annual, Monthly, Weekly) receives good feedback from Cardano Community, we will create a market report information hub to upload all our reports to free download to make many people can learn more about Cardano.\n\n"}', -- extra

It is enough to look at major corporate financial reports to validate it.\n\n \n\n\nHere is an example of Nestle\u0092 2020 annual financial report (The summary already includes some key relevant information), which highlights that Nestle\u0092s internal stakeholders see climate and decarbonization, innovative business models, digital and technology having a major impact on Nestle\u0092s success.\n\n \n\n\nhttps://www.nestle.com/sites/default/files/2021-03/2020-annual-review-en.pdf\n\n \n\n\nwww.nestle.com/media/pressreleases/allpressreleases/nestle-annual-report-2020\n\n \n\n\nThe proposal suggests a model to contact a large number of impact businesses as well as developing the model for the onboarding process.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWhy it is important? Companies are finally discovering the power of blockchain technologies and Cardano is ready to onboard exciting B2B and B2C solutions.\n\n \n\n\nTransparency and traceability are huge opportunities for impact driven businesses to show their value, build trustworthiness and new models. DID, smart contract, open ledgers, credentials and more are all important building blocks that could support impact businesses work.\n\n \n\n\nThe proposal will enable further capacity to focus on approaching many relevant businesses and through the collaboration with Cardano\u0092s ecosystem, help businesses increase efficiency, transparency, and stakeholder engagement, as well as expand business to new areas.

The basis cost of the 2021 rewards is aggregated and delivered to the user for income reporting. The basis cost of a reward is calculated as the weighted average of true additions (positive transactions that remain immobile for a significant period of staking) prior to the reward being generated.

As such the proposals to this challenge would need to present a detailed timeframe and roadmap to implement a working solution.\n\nUse case example:\n\nAs a key component in the creation of a trustworthy, Cardano based, robustly & elegantly interoperable NFT storage platform.\n\nWhat use is having the record of ownership on an immutable blockchain, if the work that it points to is no longer accessible? Only the metadata gets stored on the blockchain, if the file it points to is no longer available because the location the metadata leads to is no longer available, the NFT itself would probably loses most of its value, regardless if it\u0092s a piece of digital art, music, or a land lease with attached plans.\n\nPicture how the media would cover the story of an NTF artwork, or possibly even worse, the files attached to the metadata that somebody paid hundreds of thousands of dollars suddenly not being there anymore. After an event such as that, storage permanence would surely become the biggest concern of the general public.\n\n\u00a0As this is a broad and complex problem we don\u0092t necessarily expect full working solutions to emerge out of this first iteration of the challenge.

Ethiopia is the first country issuing educational records as Verifiable Credentials (VC) on Cardano and Fairway aims to be the first business in the market actually utilizing those records within our platform. Currently we are working on introducing PRISM connection to our platform in two ways related to recruitment. You can find detailed information here on the following proposals:\n\n\\* Integrating PRISM to our recruitment platform to verify education efficiently for recruiting businesses as part of the recruitment process: Recruitment Utilizing Atala PRISM\n\\* Becoming an issuer of Proof of Employment -credentials for users who have got recruited through through our platform and proven by both parties involved: Employment Credentials on PRISM\n\n \n\n\nWe propose to bring this improvement to Zanzibar with our complete recruitment SaaS. What makes Zanzibar a unique place to study and implement is the fact that World Mobile customers have an existing DID that can be leveraged in both ways with this approach. The World Mobile customers can sync their DID''s to our system and share their credentials as part of the recruitment process. A job seeker can for example utilize the credentials that they got through the use of World Mobile services to prove their identity and trustworthy payment history. This credit can be used in our software to improve verification and trustworthiness level of a candidate.\n\n \n\n\nOur platform can then be used to efficiently create Proof of Employment -credentials for people employed in Zanzibar. The use of Fairway SaaS takes away a radical barrier of lack of technological skills and right incentives for issuing these credentials and by using it, the people of Zanzibar will have a larger set of usable and crucial credentials on their existing identity wallet. These Proof of Employment -credentials can play especially big role when applying for a loan in the bank or buying an insurance making the credit score better.\n\n \n\n\nWorld Mobile has a target of 100k new customers in Tanzania in Q1 of 2022. This means means that the potential customer base is expanding rapidly. As this World Mobile expands in Tanzania and to other markets, given our approach, it will be easy for us to expand with them in the future as well.\n\n \n\n\nTo go to a new market in 2023 we need to do a market assessment in 2022 and form a go-to-market strategy\n\n"}', -- extra

    '{"solution": "This is where Fairway steps in. We create and pilot user-friendly SaaS-based software applying Atala Prism to issue Proof of Employment-Credentials. With our approach issuing of credentials becomes easy and mutually beneficial for both job-seeker and employer. We provide recruitment SaaS to Ethiopian market that can take the credential issuing process and conveniently include it as a part of the complete recruitment process and user experience. As our software is designed to handle the complete recruitment process and interaction between a job seeker and recruiter. Once the recruiting business and the selected job seeker both sign a contract, our software has the ability to use this information to issue a Proof of Employment -credential (See a diagram attached). Our product is currently run on private demo and will go public in Ethiopia around the end of Q2 this year.\n\n \n\n\nOur goal is that , businesses with low incentives to issue credentials and no skills to do so get to participate into the credential issuing process with lowest possible barrier. By this Fairway becomes the credible issuer of these Credentials. There are, of course multiple approaches to solve the business adaptation challenge and the best practices for other more developed markets might be different. For the developing countries the level of digitalization is usually still not very high and to accelerate adaption innovations are needed. This approach provides the best solution for all the parties included. For the employees the ability to own their data as a verifiable credential and to leverage it in other aspects of life. And for the businesses the easiest possible way to participate in the process of issuing and verifying Proof of Employment -data from the decentralized network. In a country of 115 million people we believe this will be a big step towards the use of decentralized identities and VC''s on a massive scale.\n\n \n\n\nIn the future Fairway is interested in expanding this solution in two ways:\n\n1. Issue \"Proof of\"-credentials on various other things that can be used or created through recruitment process such as referencing and skill matching for job seekers as well as compliance records and reputation scoring for businesses\n\n2. Creation of blockchain based legally applicable contract management platform where the legal documents signed by the parties are directly signed on a blockchain\n\n"}', -- extra

The influx of Seniors liquidity and long term Staking of Senior money could help lift the ADA investing community.\n\nBy being at the leader position Cardano can position itself to the Worldwide Senior niche as the \u0093safe\u0094 DeFi investments. One that is based on research, science and plodding scaling all in order to be safe. Most seniors like the concept of safe and are typically-Risk Adverse.\n\nPotentially, the Ukrainian invasion has started a dialogue that will resonate with the world regarding Cryptocurriencies. This dialogue should involve all age groups including seniors. It may emphasize how The DeFi world was able to help support a beleaguered community when traditional fiat failed.\n\nThis Challenge is the start to bringing a new subset of Worldwide investors into the Cardano ecosystem. Attracting Insurers, Wealth Advisors, Bankers, IRA funds and other businesses focused on the Senior market may provide increased liquidity to the network.\n\nFunded challenges for Dapp building, specific to Seniors will begin the process. Reward programs and discount dapps directed at the \u0093fixed income\u0094 crowd will initiate conversations. Special Senior Smart contracts to incentivize clients will have Senior oriented businesses turn to Cardano. Seniors worldwide, from all walks of life, backgrounds and nationality will begin to invest in Cardano because of the Senior specific infrastructure that will be built due to this challenge.", "importance": "Diversity in an ecosystem is critical and Seniors cross all boundries and stereotypes. Grow the senior market globally to grow Cardano.", "goal": "Success looks like Mom or Dad -worldwide - safely investing and being involved in the Cardano ecosystem with understanding and confidence.", "metrics": "Creation of specific Dapps targeted to Seniors.\n\nRetirement and Ira investment systems developed to help seniors invest in Cardano.\n\nAn Increase in age 55 and up investors into the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nTraditional Senior wealth management firms investing in programs/processes in Cardano for their Senior Clients\n\nWorldwide banks linking into the Cardano ecosystem specifically for the Senior niche."}', -- extra

    '{"solution": "Entrepreneurs and developers from all over the world will be able to register their projects for a quadratic funding campaign to compete for open-source grants and funds. We want to create a rewarding incentive system for open-source projects and\u00a0accelerate the development of common tools, frameworks, core infrastructures, and proof of concepts that are created and owned by the community for the community.\n\n \n\n\nThis will allow users and projects without technical knowledge related to blockchain technologies, to launch their funding campaigns and fund them and this platform will facilitate everything directly on Cardano.\n\n \n\n\nTogether with our\u00a0Decentralized eLearning and No-code-setup Collaborative Cloud IDE (with support of 60 coding languages and frameworks including Haskell, Plutus, and Marlowe) [8], this also allows new contributors to effectively join open-source projects and build their Practical On-Chain Resume. Our combined platform accelerates the open web in and out of the Cardano network by tapping into the network effect in the broader open-source community. [9] [10] [11]\n\n \n\n\nGlobal crowdfunding exploded from $8.61 billion in 2020 to $113.52 billion last year \u0096 a 1,021% increase with an average of $1,315 per investor. [12]\u00a076% of investors believe it is important to fund Women and Minority entrepreneurs. Investment crowdfunding has proven itself as a scalable way to do that. [13]\n\n \n\n\nIf we can execute well to build this quadratic funding platform, the Cardano open-source community will immensely benefit from the crowdfunding''s massive growth to become a $239.78 billion industry by 2026 with an\u00a018.97% year-over-year growth rate. [14] Better access to opportunities, funding, and learning bring developers and entrepreneurs together to co-create.\n\n \n\n\nTake Gitcoin as an example of why quadratic voting and funding build trust between individuals, bigger projects, and major donors within and outside of ETH and the open-source ecosystem. GitCoin was able to drive $58,275,259 funding to open source projects with major donors matching individuals'' funding of their passion open source project. [15] [16] We can do better especially with the Catalyst community and our Fortune 1000 partners, perhaps becoming the first major fund matching donors on this platform. The sheer hiring demand and the average hiring costs of $28,548.00 to $35,684.00 for developers with real (open source) work experience by bigger projects and companies creates a perfect storm for a platform like this. [17] We believe that with our Fortune 1000 relationships, API access to a network of 840 million professionals, and Cardano''s Gitcoin, we can drive this huge appetite of major projects and companies to join this quadratic funding matching community to fund more and also bigger open-source teams. ??\n\n \n\n\nPlease make sure to also check out the links and attachments to see\u00a0the evidence of the benefits quadratic voting and funding platforms like GitCoin have on the open-source community in and outside of the Ethereum network in 2021 alone. We need the same and better for the Cardano network.

Allowing all the world''s people to benefit from blockchain technology does not only make business sense. It makes human sense.\n\n \n\n\nA social enterprise is a business with specific social or environmental objectives as its primary purpose of existence. Social enterprises seek to maximize both impact and profits, and the profits are largely channeled back to serve the purpose of the organization. Design thinking, truly understanding the target group''s needs and ability to scale the solutions after a few iterations of \"trial and error\" are crucial for any social enterprise.\n\n \n\n\nIn this challenge, proposals can be submitted by existing social enterprises seeking to expand their business, new social enterprises seeking start-up funding, and social enterprises looking to make innovative changes to their business model through Cardano adoption.\n\n \n\n\nSocial enterprise scope will need to be clearly articulated and verifiable during the auditing process.\n\nIn your proposal, please include information about your social enterprise with a clear focus on its community outreach significance and scope, for example:\n\n \n\n\n\\* A Social Enterprise seeking to begin business activities from the ground up;\n\\* An existing business looking to innovate on Cardano;\n\\* Focus of the Social Enterprise (e.g. Environmental, Social, Cultural)\n\\* Scope of the Social Enterprise (e.g. Public, Community)\n\n \n\n\nProposals should include the long-term vision, strategy and roadmap for business development. Short-term deliverables attainable in the next 6-9 months should also be included. Applications can be accompanied by audiovisual material to assist the illustration of complex solutions.\n\n \n\n\nAlignment with Fund9 strategic goals\n\nAll Challenge Setting proposals have to meet one or more of these attributes:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\* \\*Prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem.\\*\n\\* This challenge setting proposal taps into existing ESG trend (Environmental, Social and Governance) and can therefore bring in a plethora of existing initiatives from outside of Cardano. It also solidifies Cardano''s status as a RealFi chain.\n\\* \\*Turn Cardano into an open source project.\\*\n\\* This challenge setting proposal encourages collaboration between new and existing social businesses, that are by nature more inclined to share good practices. In the business of creating positive impact we all win or lose together.\n\\* \\*Accelerate the growth and evolution of developer & app ecosystem.\\*\n\\* All social enterprises building on Cardano will offer meaningful opportunities for Cardano developers to create impactful solutions.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nChallenge Team Profiles\n\n \n\n\nStef Montanari Single Stake Pool Operator, eResearch Analyst and published Research Scientist;\n\n \n\n\nTomi Astikainen was a social entrepreneurship pioneer as he introduced the concept to Finland back in 2009. He has been successfully coordinating work in several challenge teams;\n\n \n\n\nCollaborators are welcome, please reach out to @rabbitholepools if you wish to have your relevant experience listed here.\n\n", "importance": "Powering existing and starting Social Enterprises with blockchain and introducing new types of social innovations can supercharge progress.\n\n", "goal": "New Social Enterprises being brought to life and existing ones renewing their business models through Cardano adoption.\n\n", "metrics": "1.

Those problem areas could include support for improving or creating tools, coordination, resolving governance issues, improving user experience etc.\n\\* Support the community - Contributors should understand the ecosystem and be able to help the community where it''s needed. That could be answering questions, pointing people to the right resources or bringing more awareness to different areas of the ecosystem that need support.\n\\* High collaboration - Contributors have the power to be the glue that brings the community together and identifies overlapping or duplicated efforts. The community benefits by contributors spending time understanding different related projects and bringing those together where it would be a benefit to them and the ecosystem.\n\\* High participation - To be highly effective contributors will need to understand what is happening across the ecosystem to the best of their ability. Contributors may sensibly focus on one or a few areas within the ecosystem where they ensure they are up to date and are aware of the problems, projects, teams and roadmap.\n\\* Flexible - Contributors will be most impactful if they are able to be flexible in a fast moving environment and move to where they can have a high impact.\n\n \n\n\nWhat should contributors report?\n\n \n\n\n\\* Progress reports - Contributors will report weekly progress reports on what they have been working on in the community, any blockers they have and anything else they feel is relevant.\n\\* KPI reports - Contributors would not need to report KPI reports like normal idea focussed proposals do. Instead they would focus on increased regularity of progress reports that keep the community up to date on how they are contributing to the ecosystem.\n\n \n\n\nWhat sort of candidates are most suitable?\n\n \n\n\n\\* Approachable - You understand the community will reach out to you regularly and will need to be friendly and supportive to community members.\n\\* Outcome focussed - You understand that the problems within any ecosystem are complex and take time to overcome but are able to communicate and collaborate on finding solutions.\n\\* Open minded - You have insights but are always open to new ideas on how to solve a problem. You look to include all perspectives when solving problems.\n\\* Pragmatic - You understand solving problems often doesn''t start with the perfect solution.

Achieving this will create a thriving community, an easier to use development ecosystem and nurture a growing list of products and integrations.\n\n \n\n\nThe better that Catalyst is able to effectively help with governing and distributing funds the faster the ecosystem can create the innovations and adoption needed for Cardano to thrive. The better open source tools are made available for governance and identity within the ecosystem the faster interesting and novel solutions can be deployed.\n\n \n\n\nTypes of proposals to include\n\n\\* Governance tools, libraries & SDKs - Tools that help with governance participation and decision making that can be used by Catalyst but also could be used by other teams building in the ecosystem. Tools for governance will help the Catalyst function more effectively as a DAO.\n\\* DAO tools, libraries & SDKs - Development that helps the wider community to build DAOs for their own projects.\n\\* Identity tools, libraries & SDKs - Identity tools that help with Catalyst governance or that could be used in other applications in the wider ecosystem. Identity solutions could be Atala PRISM focussed but could also be integrations of other identity systems into the Cardano ecosystem.\n\\* Rapid funding mechanisms - New rapid funding mechanisms looking at improving the distribution of funding of the Cardano treasury.\n\\* Auditing tools or processes - Tools and process improvements that help with auditing funded proposals to help ensure they have the support needed to maximise the impact produced.\n\\* Catalyst accelerators & mentors - Tools, guides, mentors and programs that help people with going through the Catalyst funding process and working on their project.\n\\* Resources, processes, hosted discussions & documentation - Proposals aimed at helping improve understanding and engagement with the Catalyst ecosystem or around governance topics such as improving decision making or processes for how the community reaches consensus.\n\\* Governance research and analysis - Research and analysis projects that will help improve how the community can approach governance. This can include exploring existing or new governance models that could improve how the community approaches distributed governance.\n\\* Education - Demos, guides, videos or documentation for improving the education resources available about the different governance and identity tools, libraries and processes available in the ecosystem.\n\n \n\n\nPotential success metrics for proposal types\n\n \n\n\nThis list is not exhaustive but does provides some ideas for proposers to consider.\n\n \n\n\n\\* Governance tools, libraries & SDKs - Amount of adoption from other projects, improvement metrics from any adoption in Catalyst ecosystem.\n\\* DAO tools, libraries & SDKs - Amount of adoption from other projects, improvement metrics from any adoption in Catalyst ecosystem.\n\\* Identity tools, libraries & SDKs - Amount of adoption from other projects, improvement metrics from any adoption in Catalyst ecosystem.\n\\* Rapid funding mechanisms - Number of participants involved in governance process, speed of funding distribution, number of projects supported through mechanism.\n\\* Auditing tools or processes - Amount of adoption from other projects, number of projects being audited, number of projects receiving extra support, number of projects having funding halted due to lack of execution.\n\\* Catalyst accelerators & mentors - Number of projects onboarded onto support programs, number of projects supported.\n\\* Resources, processes & documentation - Number of viewers on content, reduction in common questions support due to better resources or documentation.\n\\* Governance research and analysis - Number of citations, number of projects utilising research or analysis in their execution.\n\\* Education - Number of viewers or participants of education resource, testimonies on the quality of the resources made from community feedback.\n\n \n\n\nConsiderations for proposers\n\n \n\n\n\\* Open source plan - Any tools, libraries or SDKs are encouraged to be open source either from the start or as soon as possible.

    '{"brief": "Fund 8 is expected to set the ball moving for proposals from India and India focussed proposals. By the refine stage of Fund 7, the proposals in total have exceeded twice the allocated funds.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEmurgo recently conducted their first training for Haskell/Plutus in India. The first outgoing batch from that course can add firepower to the builder community in India. This challenge will provide sufficient funding space for those builders as well as those who are already actively working on Cardano from India.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA few more funding rounds would help to gather the necessary amount of momentum for the sustenance of the community growth.\n\n\u00a0\n\nRecent signals from the government have been considered positive toward blockchain based industry. In the annual budget for the year 2022, the government has announced a tax rate on profits for crypto investors. Before the budget, there has been lack of clarity due to rumors of a crypto ban. The government has called out that it is pro blockchain technology and the announcement of tax rate is considered tilting the scale towards regulations rather than bans. Generating awareness about Cardano for its technology merit is important in this backdrop.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSome suggestions for this challenge:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\* Fund dApps and services based on Cardano built by Indian teams optionally in collaboration with external teams.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\* Set up new Cardano community hubs or expand existing ones in India\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\* Create and promote content in local languages to attract different sections of the Indian society to Cardano.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\* Build dApps with social / environmental impact.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\* Initiatives that can improve goodwill among the general population as well as the government by demonstrating benefits of Cardano.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe IT sector in India is well developed and is the topmost off-shoring destination for IT companies across the world, employing close to 5 million professionals. In addition to driving the growth of the digital economy internally India offers cost-effectiveness to global companies. Mobilizing such a large population and workforce will benefit Cardano.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n", "importance": "Big population, young demography and a large IT sector. Abundant scope to leverage socio-economic and environmental projects using Cardano.\n\n", "goal": "* Proposers from India in future Catalyst Funds.\n\n  \n\n\n* Real world projects with impact.\n\n\u00a0\n\n* Expansion of Cardano India community.\n", "metrics": "* Number of local projects aiming for impact.\n\n  \n\n\n* dApps and projects implemented to completion.\n\n  \n\n\n* Qualitative improvement of sentiment for favorable legislation.\n\n  \n\n\n* Number of proposals that can improve awareness about Cardano or grow the Indian community.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n"}', -- extra

This is in no way a statement of blame but simply a statement from a differing perspective. The reason for this is because we have cut corners despite trying to move as slowly as possible. In the hurry to create all these great projects to better the world, we have not thought about the first tool used to create these projects. That tool being logic.\n\n \n\n\nLogic has evolved to the point it is; to many in this block-chain business simply code or ways that machines communicate with each other. However, this is only a version of what logic could be much like the form of logic I will present to you today.\n\n \n\n\nThe lens this essay is written from is through an Aristotelian way of thinking about logic. Logic being the way we reason correctly. This essay is less about blockchain technology, but an end goal of reasoning the data we humans are fed through news, social media and video. No cryptocurrency has sought to redefine the way in which we come to logical conclusions. As a result, we are simply creating a Frankenstein like creature with a new body on a dead head. If we were to attach the decentralized financial system to the rest of the world today, we would simply be putting an organ into a body that would reject it. In fact, we can see its rejection whenever we hear about FUD. This is where proof of Article would come into play.\n\n \n\n\nProof of Article calls for a new form of information interpretation and logical conclusion through decentralized input and output. It is an attempt to be the new printing press. With the rise of the internet, news can now be criticized, interpreted, and communicated by many. As a result, this has led to what many people call ''Fake News'' or ''Misinformation''. However, what if a system existed in which different nodes could verify the quality of an Article?\n\n \n\n\n\\* \n"}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "Just as any community, Catalyst, the larger Cardano community, and the blockchain space overall are full of apparent and acute, but also simmering or hidden conflicts.\n\n\n\nConflicts are not inherently bad, as they present opportunities for growth and increased understanding between disputing parties. However, for these positives to manifest, conflict has to be properly transformed. As it has been increasingly made apparent, so far, we are not doing a great job overall as a community in breaking down the barriers that keep sub-communities apart. This situation has already led to community members reducing their involvement with Catalyst or turning their backs on Cardano altogether.\n\n\n\nThe key question then is how do we end something destructive and build something desired.\n\n\n\nWhile the purpose is to promote constructive change processes that may offer immediate solutions, the focus is on building strong relationships within and outside of the Cardano community.\n\n\n\nConflict transformation borrows from indigenous peacemaking, civil rights, and non-violent resistance movements.

    '{"solution": "How does browser-based support for transactions help Cardano?\n\n \n\n\nOn Ethereum, web browser applications form a common interface for users to transact against the blockchain. Typically, in-browser wallets facilitate this process by injecting a Web3 provider object into the browser. This Web3 object links the user''s wallet to publicly accessible nodes, allowing wallets like Metamask to sign transactions and manage private keys within the browser for seamless interaction with the network.\n\n \n\n\nTooling on Cardano has aimed to match this user experience, but progress remains to be made. Formerly, suggestions arose in support of an integrated backend product that would handle this interfacing in a generic manner for the majority of applications.\n\n \n\n\nWe believe, however, a series of transaction-building libraries will provide a clearer path forward. Using our Cardano-Transaction-Library (CTL), developers will be able to mix and match tools that, when configured appropriately, will help streamline transaction creation and maintenance in browser-based or javascript environments (e.g., mobile, server). More concretely, the CTL will perform the heavy lifting of building transactions to meet the requirements of a smart contract \u0096 typically non-trivial \u0096 while automating more generic effects such as balancing transactions.\n\n \n\n\nCardano-Serialization-Library vs Cardano-Transaction-Library\n\n \n\n\nThe Cardano-Serialization-Library (CSL) is a popular tool among dApp developers. As described in the documentation, it \"is a library, written in Rust, for serialization & deserialization of data structures used in Cardano''s Haskell implementation of Alonzo along with useful utility functions.\" Essentially, the library supports the serialization and deserialization of data structures included in Cardano transactions so that they can be submitted against the blockchain efficiently. It also provides various wallet utilities for generating keys and addresses, managing the minutiae of transaction creation, handling metadata, and so on.\n\n \n\n\nThat said, the CSL has limitations and pain points remain. The CTL seeks to address these and utilizes the CSL in so doing. The CTL, however, is in general a higher-level solution that automates transaction creation by querying the blockchain, via Ogmios, to gather the necessary information. It also abstracts over the wallet, meaning developers need only rely on declarative API function calls without worrying about the specifics of individual light clients. Overall, CTL relies on these tools as it aims to provide an all-encompassing solution for building/submitting transactions and interacting with wallets.\n\n"}', -- extra

However, unlike traditional futures contracts, perpetual contracts do not expire, meaning costly rollovers are unnecessary.\n\n \n\n\nMore importantly, perpetual contracts are flexible. Traders can apply leverage to trades relative to their deposited collateral, increasing capital efficiency and profitability. Alongside long and short positions, this allows for more complex strategies around hedging, arbitrage, and so on. EternalSwap also employs funding payments between market participants to ensure prices across the exchange track their underlying assets.\n\n \n\n\nvAMMs\n\n \n\n\nUniswap popularized the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model of decentralized exchanges. Rather than rely on an order book to sort trades, an AMM exchange prices assets along a constant product curve described by the simplified equation x \\\\* y = k. Assets held in liquidity pools may be freely traded as long their available amounts preserve this price relationship.\n\n \n\n\nWhile useful, basic AMMs suffer from several shortcomings, not least of which is impermanent loss. Fortunately, virtual AMMs (vAMMs) bypass the issue by foregoing the actual asset swap. Rather, buyers and sellers arrive and leave with stablecoins and are compensated relative to the performance of their positions. Traders need only lock their collateral with EternalSwap and price discovery occurs without exchanging the underlying. This virtualization means impermanent loss and slippage are not an issue.\n\n"}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "Challenge Updates\n\n \n\n\n\\* Top 3 Challenge Category in Fund 8 (see attached).\n\\* 3x Funded Challenge Setting Proposal (Fund 5, 6 and 7)\n\n \n\n\nA selection of past-funded ''Scale-Up Hubs'':\n\n \n\n\n\\* Vietnamese Hub\n\\* Cardano Builders'' Hub India\n\\* Cardano Blockchain Lab in Kenya\n\\* Homeless Hubs\n\\* Cardano in South L.A.\n\\* Cardano in Buenos Aires\n\n \n\n\nWhat this means:\n\n \n\n\n1. Demand is growing for this category and we are only at the beginning of what is possible with a network of Cardano hubs globally. The network effect will take hold at some point and when it does, we need to be ready with templates, guides and materials on creating and sustaining a new Cardano Community Hub (CCH).\n2. The impact is real and ROI is being met. Real lives are being affected and improved through this category. This creates a win-win, positive feedback loop as more people benefit from the solutions we offer them, there is even more demand for these services worldwide.\n\n \n\n\nWhile we are Scaling UP community hubs, we need to Scale DOWN individual capital outlay, to ensure that we can spread as far as possible, as quickly as possible, which is why we work from first principles.\n\n \n\n\n1. Delivering information to people who would not otherwise have the access.\n2. Ensuring resilience and self-reliance within that community.\n\n \n\n\nWhen we approach hubs from the lens of information-delivery nodes, we can build a hub taxonomy within a need-impact matrix and then find the most capital efficient model for each location.\n\n \n\n\nIn other words, consider why a hub exists, in the context of it''s location, access to infrastructure and community readiness. Then design a hub according to those factors, with a traditional brick-and-mortar (CTH) being only one out of many potential information-delivery systems within a local community.\n\n \n\n\nWith this said, a focus more on ''minimum-viable hubs'' (MVHs) is needed. What is the smallest effective unit for a hub, and by identifying this unit, can we begin to scale CCHs more rapidly.\n\n \n\n\nHow is the Fund 9 challenge different?\n\n \n\n\nIn addition to the previous round\u0092s challenge goals, this round will introduce the additional components of tooling, measurement and support for hubs.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\n\\* The question is: How do we ensure that community hubs are optimizing and scaling efficiently?\n\\* The answer is: By providing documentation around best practices, building tools that support growth and tracking performance across the global hub network.\n\n \n\n\nIn this way, not only is the network of hubs growing with each challenge, but the introduction of supporting frameworks and tools allows them to scale efficiently.\n\n \n\n\nSupporting partners:\n\n \n\n\nFor Cardano to achieve its ambition of being a global financial and social infrastructure that banks the unbanked, solves wicked problems and pushes for \u0093a more connected, transparent and fair configuration for both the flow of ideas and value\u0094, collaborating for the greater good is key, as outlined by SDG 17, \u0093Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development.\u0094\n\n \n\n\nDuring Fund 6, a community challenge category supported such endeavors, entitled \u0093Partnerships for Global Adoption\u0094 - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/campaigns/26114/stage/all/ideas/unspecified\n\n \n\n\nCardano stands out in the marketplace of ideas, as a \u0093blockchain for good\u0094, enabling, equipping and empowering \u0091blockchangers\u0092 to solve local, and global problems, helping to build a more equitable, prosperous world for all. The time has come for the Cardano community to scale up in connecting grassroots led hubs within a decentralized impact network, to multinational, multilateral institutions, for greater collective intelligence and positive social and environmental impact.\n\n \n\n\nIn that spirit, supporting partners have rallied, met the call, and are keen to join forces to collaborate with Project Catalyst to scale up our Community Hubs:\n\n \n\n\n\\* The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 54 independent and equal countries. It is home to 2.5 billion people, and includes both advanced economies and developing countries. 32 of our members are small states, including many island nations. Member governments have agreed to shared goals like development, democracy and peace. Their values and principles are expressed in the Commonwealth Charter. The Commonwealth''s roots go back to the British Empire. But today any country can join the modern Commonwealth. The last country to join the Commonwealth was Rwanda in 2009. https://thecommonwealth.org/about-us.\n\n \n\n\n\\* The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) \u00a0is the most inclusive intergovernmental platform in the Asia-Pacific region. The Commission promotes cooperation among its 53 member States and 9 associate members in pursuit of solutions to sustainable development challenges. ESCAP is one of the five regional commissions of the United Nations. The ESCAP secretariat supports inclusive, resilient and sustainable development in the region by generating action-oriented knowledge, and by providing technical assistance and capacity-building services in support of national development objectives, regional agreements and the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. ESCAP also provides support to partners at the national level. ESCAP\u0092s national offer is rooted in and linked with the implementation of global and regional intergovernmental frameworks, agreements, and other instruments. The outline of the ESCAP\u0092s Offer of Support at the national level is available here. ESCAP pursues this objective by carrying out work, in close cooperation with other United Nations entities and intergovernmental organizations in the region. https://www.unescap.org/our-work\n\n \n\n\n\\* Accelerate 2030, initiated by UNDP and Impact Hub, is the world\u0092s largest program supporting entrepreneurs from developing and emerging markets to scale their solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They leverage the strengths and reach of the global Impact Hub network, United Nations organizations, corporates, investors and expert partners to scale entrepreneurial innovations while contributing to a shift towards a more sustainable economy. Operating in hubs across 20+ locations, Accelerate2030 provides one-of-a-kind scaling support to entrepreneurs through National Scale-Ready Programs across Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America, followed by a Global Scaling Program for those with the highest international scaling potential. https://accelerate2030.net/.\n\n \n\n\n\\* One Million Mentors (1MM) is a unique, community-based mentoring project with one simple aim: to connect one million young people with one million life-changing opportunities. This is even more important right now given the impact of COVID-19 on young people. We back the talents of young people to improve their career chances, while at the same time strengthening local communities. 1MM was founded on the belief that through personal, one-to-one mentoring, more young people can grow the knowledge, networks, skills and confidence they need to succeed. By giving them online access to a trained mentor every young person in the country can have the chance to reach their potential. Together we are meeting the challenge and creating social change, on a national scale. https://onemillionmentors.org.uk/about-1mm/\n\n \n\n\nDue to the scope of the challenge, the proven demand for its place on the regular roster and the large institutional partners who have broadcasted interest in participating on a scale previously unseen by Catalyst and the Scale-Up Hubs community, we are now requesting a 3x budget from the last round.\n\n \n\n\nAdditional Success Metrics:\n\n \n\n\nHubs:\n\n \n\n\n\\* Is the hub''s Fund 9 proposal in keeping with the MVH principle?\n\\* Do they have an understanding of their target audience?\n\\* Can they accurately project their reach (physical and online)?\n\\* Can they accurately project the number of onboarded members to the hub?\n\\* Have they given an indication of a financial sustainability model?\n\\* Have they given an indication of budget costs vs ''cost to launch''? (eg. A CTH may only apply for 1/5 of their cost to launch due to the demand pressures of acquiring catalyst funding)\n\n \n\n\nTools & Frameworks:\n\n \n\n\n\\* Can this tool or framework apply generally across all hubs?\n\\* Does this business framework have past case studies of successful implementation?\n\\* Does this online tool require a license fee or is it an open standard?\n\\* Does it include analytics and performance measurement?\n\\* Do the tools or frameworks integrate well with the existing hub services?\n\n \n\n\nRatings by CAs and Voters should favour:\n\n \n\n\n\\* Proposals that offer online tools that will support the global hub network.\n\\* Proposals that offer professional services to the global hub network.\n\\* Proposals that offer documentation and business frameworks to the global hub network.\n\\* Proposals that catalyze growth and employment opportunities in their local communities.\n\\* Proposals that account for local needs and infrastructure concerns.\n\\* Proposals that show creativity and ingenuity around hub design and information delivery.\n\\* Proposals that are using local, recyclable materials and have a commitment to sustainability practices.\n\n \n\n\n---------------\n\n \n\n\nLet''s build an ecosystem that is truly global, allowing everyone to participate to the best of their ability, whatever level they are starting from.\n\n \n\n\nWhen you drive adoption at the ground level, you are doing more than just ''building cool products'', you are empowering people to change their lives in ways they could have never imagined by themselves.\n\n \n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/zK5ralU\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/feXUVDF\n\n \n\n\nExtra resources:\n\n \n\n\n\\* Cumbria, UK Business Hub: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sellafield-invests-26m-to-create-cumbria-business-hub\n\\* Rwanda Business Hub: https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/norrsken-foundations-hub-opens-in-rwanda-to-house-1000-entrepreneurs-by-next-year\n\n \n\n\nPast-funded challenges:\n\n \n\n\n\\* Scale-UP Community Hubs (F7)\n\\* Scale-UP Community Hubs (F6)\n\\* Scale-UP Community Hubs (F5)\n\n \n\n\n-------------\n\n \n\n\n\\*Interested in shaping the next-generation of blockchain innovation centers?\\* Join the conversation at https://t.me/ScaleUpHubs\n\n", "importance": "With dozens of community hubs now funded, we need a more sophisticated approach to scaling that includes documentation, tooling and support.\n\n", "goal": "Local Community Hubs across the world where the average person can take part in their own language and with their own cultural understanding\n\n", "metrics": "* How many new hubs were launched in 2022?\n* How many countries have at least one community hub?\n* How many new tools were created to support the global hub network?\n* How many hubs improved their processes by applying the frameworks and tools offered?\n* How many developers did this challenge bring into the Cardano ecosystem?\n* How many new users of Cardano were onboarded?\n* How many external organizations did this community-focused challenge bring into the Cardano ecosystem?\n"}', -- extra

On the long term, all of the community-funded projects should be open and transparent by following common standards.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOne of the main purposes of this tool is to create common standards that the community uses to research and assess a project prior to investing in it or using it. This tool has a baseline of research questions and weighting that was assigned by our dev team, but we are soliciting feedback from the community so that it will reflect what we all agree is relevant when performing research. If we are all using a similar set of criteria to research and judge a projects strengths and weaknesses, then we will all be aligned while discussing and debating them within our ecosystem. It will also increase adoption, as the community will quickly be able to identify which are the quality projects and which have several red flags present. Finally, we we have agreed as a community what we believe is important from a project, it will begin to affect how projects behave in order to be successful. If the community agrees that huge allocations to insiders or unqualified dev teams are unacceptable, than we will see less teams and projects with these characteristics because they will not has as much investment as the projects which do conform to our standards.\n\n \n\n\nThere should be observable improvements: easier to discover projects and find project resources, more intuitive to access project knowledge base (documentation, how-to, etc.), and simple to find and contact project members.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWe are currently working to include a search functionality on the website so that users can search a project and find reports that have already been completed. Longer term, we would like it to have the functionality that the community can upvote the highest quality projects so that the community is self-selecting which reports investors should be paying attention to. Also, one of the key features of the DYOR Tool is that it creates a research report that can be shared with the community (currently has this functionality). A good report will contains links to supporting documentation such as dev team contact info, website, GitHub, etc. By encouraging the community to use the tool and share their research, we will eventually create a complete library with multiple reports for each project in the Cardano ecosystem. Our hope is that this will be a one stop solution for anything who is beginning their research journey into Cardano and can find high quality research reports for every project.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWe should observe an increase in reputability of the Cardano Open Source projects. The measure can be done by looking at media communications of various open source communities.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWe expect the DYOR Tool to be responsible for a large increase in the reputability of the Cardano Open Source Projects. The tool will hopefully get the community focused on researching all aspects of every project, and doing it with a similar set of criteria while sharing this research so that the entire community is aware of it. By putting a big spotlight onto each project, it will reduce the number of bad actors who choose to build on Cardano and encourage the good actors. By having a well-informed community that can spot potential issues and demand transparency or changes, it will become more trouble than it\u0092s worth for bad actors to build on Cardano which will ultimately lead to an increase in reputability because all projects are being thoroughly vetted.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHow will the outcomes of your project be communicated or marketed once completed?\n\n \n\n\nWe will provide updates on the outcomes of this project through our Discord, Twitter, and Reddit accounts (more details in the \u0093what does success look like\u0094 section) to ensure the community is kept well informed of our progress and completion.\n\n"}', -- extra

    '{"solution": "A specification language for sound dApp design\n\n \n\n\nSmart contracts within Cardano consist of scripts that control how UTXOs, pieces of value with an associated piece of data (the datum), can be consumed by transactions. Unlike the global nature of smart contracts on Ethereum, a Cardano script can only perform a local inspection of the consuming transaction. This means that the implementation of a contract (i.e., the script) is often divorced from the desired semantics of its operation.\n\n \n\n\nMoreover, it is generally non-trivial to decipher the intention of a smart contract from its raw implementation. This has reaching consequences for a smart contract blockchain like Cardano. Here, all smart contract code is public and endpoints can be evoked by anyone, at any time, to irrevocably change the state of the ledger. This open nature inadvertently creates massive incentives to exploit poorly designed applications.\n\n \n\n\nOur goal is to create a specification language, an embedded DSL, in which we can describe the semantics of a dApp system in its entirety, from an inter-transaction perspective rather than an intra-transaction perspective. More concretely, our specification language consists of a way of specifying transactions (e.g., changes to the state of the ledger) and combinations of transactions as well as the conditions under which they should validate. In general, this involves delineating subsets of transaction types (transaction families) as well as defining the way tokens can flow between UTXOs and the sequence of events upon which their transfer is predicated.\n\n \n\n\nHow does formal specification help Cardano?\n\n \n\n\nA major selling point of Cardano is that its core language and smart contract language are amenable to formal verification. This means smart contracts can be, more or less, mathematically proven to be secure. As noted in the Cardano documentation, \u0093specification derived from white papers looks a lot like Haskell code, and connecting the two is considerably easier than doing so with an imperative language.\u0094\n\n \n\n\nIt is also useful to recall Cardano''s multi-asset ledger lends itself to a wide range of use cases for tokens in comparison to single-asset ledgers such as Ethereum. Developers will be able to use our specification to delineate the properties and legal state transitions that govern their applications.\n\n \n\n\nSuch a specification can then be translated to program code which can be tested to behave as intended per the properties encoded using our specification language. For properly designed smart contracts, users will have a high degree of assurance that the dApps they interact with behave as intended and are unable to enter undesirable states where value may be inadvertently lost.\n\n \n\n\nJust as important, however, our DSL will streamline dApp designs and generate tests to ensure an implementation functions as intended. This will dramatically reduce auditor and developer time while significantly reducing costs.\n\n"}', -- extra
