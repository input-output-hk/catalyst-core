# mdbook-linkcheck will interpolate environment variables into your header via
# $IDENT.
#
# If this is not what you want you must escape the `$` symbol, like `\$TOKEN`.
# `\` itself can also be escaped via `\\`.
#
# Note: If interpolation fails, the header will be skipped and the failure will
# be logged. This can be useful if a particular header isn't always necessary,
# but may be helpful (e.g. when working with rate limiting).
