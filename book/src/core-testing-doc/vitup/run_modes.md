### Configuration modes

In order to take out the burden of providing entire configuration vitup has two configuration modes:

- `quick` - which runs on defaults and allow user to override most important parameters using cli arguments:

`vitup start quick`

- `advanced` - which allows to defined full configuration as well as external static files for proposals and challenges

`vitup start advanced`

### Run Modes

There are 4 run modes available in vitup:
- `interactive` - where user can push some fragments or query status of nodes 
- `endless` - [Default] just simple run until stopped by user
- `service` - additional manager service will be published at `0.0.0.0:3030` and allow to control (stop/start) and provides resources over http (qr codes or secret keys)
- `mock` - lightweight version of backend with does not spawn any jormungandr or vit-servicing-station services. Mock is also capable of controlling more backend aspect than normal deployment (cut off the connections, rejects all fragments.


### Endless mode

There are two ways of starting vitup in endless mode. One with limited configuration and one with giving full control. 

`vitup start quick --mode endless ..` or

`vitup start advanced --mode endless ..`


### Service mode

`vitup start quick --mode service ..` or

`vitup start advanced --mode service ..`

Once environment is up one can check status or modify existing environment:

#### Admin Operations
- start -  in order to start new voting
- stop -  stops currently running vote backend (usually it takes 1 min to stop it)
- status -  check status of environment: <br/>
  a) `Idle` - environment is not started, <br/>
  b) `Starting` - environment is starting, please wait until its status is `Running`, <br/>
  c) `Running` - environment is not running and should be accessible, <br/>
  d) `Stopping` - environment is stopping, please wait until its `Idle` to start it with different parameters,
  
- files: 
In order to get qr-codes or secret files from env, two operations are provided: <br/>
  a) `List Files` - list all files in data directory for current run, <br/>
  b) `Get File` - downloads particular file which is visible in `List Files` operation result,

#### how to send operations

Voting backend admin console is an REST API accessible over http or https on port 3030. Using POST/GET http methods admin can send some operations to environment.
There are various apps capable of sending REST commands. The simplest is to download `Postman` and use UI to fire up commands.

1. Download postman: `https://www.postman.com/downloads/`
2. Review quick guide, how to send dummy request: `https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/sending-the-first-request/`
3. Review guide, how to send different requests with arguments: `https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/`

#### list files

User can list or view files available for current voting. to list all available files `/api/control/files/list` endpoint can be utilized. Then relative path can be provided in `/api/control/files/get/..` endpoint. For example:
`http://{env_endpoint}:3030/api/control/files/get/qr-codes/zero_funds_12_0000.png`


- Request Type: GET
- Endpoint : http://{env_endpoint}:3030/files/get/{file_path}
