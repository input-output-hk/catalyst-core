# Spellcheck Dictionaries

These Dictionaries are used to spellcheck this repo.
Updates to these dictionaries should be a stand-alone PR.

Currently, the following languages are supported and allowed:

The rules for spellchecking files in this repo are as follows:

* Tool: `hunspell`
* Language: `en_US`
* Extra Words: The spellchecker MUST support extra word dictionaries.
  * This is so that additional words can be consistently checked.

This is to enforce a minimum standard and assist to create high-quality documentation.
