# Iapyx

Iapyx is a wallet cli & wallet api project which operates on catalyst-jormungandr network.

WARNING: main purpose of the wallet is testing. Do NOT use it on production.

## Build & Install

In order to build iapyx in main project folder run:
```
cd iapyx
cargo build
cargo install --path . --force
```

## Quick Start

### CLI

Iapyx can be used as a wallet cli. It is capable of sending votes or pull data from node. The simplest usage example is available by using commands:


* register new wallet based on qr code:
`iapyx wallets import qr qr_file.png --pin 1234`

* connect to node rest API:
`iapyx connect https://catalyst-backend.io/api`

* use recently created wallet for rest of commands:
`iapyx wallets use darek`

* sync with the node and get wallet data:
`iapyx wallets refresh`

* send vote:
`iapyx vote single --choice yes --pin --id {proposal_id}`

### API

Iapyx can be used as api in order to perform voting operations from the code:

```

    let wallet_proxy = spawn_network(...);
    let secret_file_path = Path::new("wallet_alice");
   

    let mut alice = iapyx::ControllerBuilder::default()
        .with_backend_from_client(wallet_proxy.client())?
        .with_wallet_from_secret_file(secret_file_path.as_ref())?
        .build()

    let proposals = alice.proposals().unwrap();
    let votes_data = proposals
        .iter()
        .take(batch_size)
        .map(|proposal| (proposal, Choice::new(0)))
        .collect();

    let fragment_ids = alice
        .votes_batch(votes_data)
        .unwrap()
        .iter()
        .map(|item| item.to_string())
        .collect();
```

## Configuration

Iapyx api doesn't use any configuration files. However cli uses small cache folder on filesystem (located in: `~/.iapyx`).
The purpose of this configuration is to store wallet lists as well as secret keys guarded by pass phrase.

Full list of commands is available on `iapyx --help` command.
