      "challenges_or_risks": "The primary risk in this deployment is finding the best balance of features for the lite version to ensure users can at least minimally function without dedicated hardware, but still encouraging users to upgrade to a hardware Spaceprinter for better results.",
      "full_solution": "The Adosia team will design, build, and deploy a new cloud based Spaceprinter into the Adosia Marketplace. The minimum viable product for the marketplace was funded through Catalyst Fund 8. This improvement will provide a less complex onramp for manufacturers who participate in production for the marketplace.\n\n \n\nThe following features will be added to the core of the marketplace functionality:\n\n \n\nCloud printer (SpacePrinter Lite, a cloud based SpacePrinter). This module will allow users who do not own the hardware for a Spaceprinter, or who lack the technical expertise to network a hardware device, to still participate in providing production to the Adosia Decentralized Marketplace. The Lite printer will handle all smart contract interactions and allow the user to manually update each physical step along the way.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nAbout Adosia Decentralized Marketplace\n\n  \n\n\nAdosia's decentralized fulfillment network is essentially composed of numerous smart contracts, including contracts for the marketplace, the printing pool, quality assurance, NFT role minting, 3d printer and shipping and receiving.\n\n  \n\n\nThe smart contract associated with the 3D printable NFT marketplace will house user-submitted 3D printable NFTs which contain one or more .stl files along with any designer royalties referenced in the NFT metadata. The user will interact with the marketplace smart contract, selecting all the NFTs they would like to have printed, which will then create a new \"purchase order\" NFT capable of traversing the decentralized Adosia 3D printer operator network. Once a user holds a purchase order NFT, upon paying an appropriate fee, they will be able to initiate a print job for that NFT with the Adosia network. Upon successful print job completion the printer operator fulfilling the print job will be paid the majority of Ada with the appropriate 3D designer(s) being paid designated royalties. The Adosia smart contract will also earn a small fee for the Adosia treasury, with all participants being incentivized early on with Adosia ADO tokens.\n\n  \n\n\nCurrent Implementation\n\n  \n\n\nAll on-chain functionality will be provided by the printing pool, purchase order, and printer registration contracts. These contracts will allow a customer to get a purchase order and have a registered printer accept the job for printing. The printer registration process has already started with the Adosia ambassador program.\n\n  \n\n\nWhat To Expect\n\n  \n\n\nUsers will be able to buy an NFT of a purchase order that will allow them to choose to print one of our special designs via a registered space printer. The printer will then ship the 3D object to the user who will receive the object and confirm its quality. At this point, the purchase order will be returned to the user and the printer will be paid ADA for their services. It is a simple product but it shows what is technically possible now. Blockchain and the tangible world will mesh together and this is just a stepping stone along that path.",

We mitigate this risk in the long term by supporting integrations to many different platforms as well as having several methods of still accessing certain data by scraping.",
      "full_solution": "The Mainline platform (https://getmainline.io/platform) is an intelligence tool to help us figure out what's real on social. It uncovers the authenticity of influencers and projects, and find what's going viral before it gets huge. With it, the community can see beyond the algorithms and echo-chambers to know what's really going on in social media.\n\n  \n\n\nThe platform is built and operated by the Mainline DAO (https://getmainline.io/) which is driven by the $MAIN token that allows holders to earn from social data that businesses use to make key decisions on where they invest their resources, as well as reward mechanisms to help collect, process & curate data. As a DAO, we also have a governance model that allows the community to prioritize features and get rewarded to participate in their development.\n\n  \n\n\nThe Mainline platform is currently live and in open alpha. You can make an account here (https://app.getmainline.com/) to get a sense for what we're building.\n\n  \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrimitives of the Mainline platform: \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReal-time streams of topics across multiple social networks visualized as a network graph-- called conversation maps-- that delivers a god-mode view for the ongoing conversations. Identify the people, topics, and trends that are driving engagement. Here's the map on Cardano from today (https://app.getmainline.com/user/cardano).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProfile pages on users, posts, hashtags, links, and media where authenticity, engagement, activity, and influence audits are requested and consumed. Browse through the top followers and engagers to get a sense for who and what is real. Use these pages to do due diligence of projects, influencers, or even yourself and your own account. Here's the Cardano profile page (https://app.getmainline.com/user/cardano). Sign up at the top right to see your own profile page.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLeaderboard pages on users, hashtags, posts, links, and media to rank by overall influence, engagement quality, and activity. Projects use these to find influencers or partners and top emerging conversations, VCs and retail investors use these to find quality projects:\n\n  \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMainline Algos\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe've developed a set of algos that provide visibility of both what's going viral as well as who and what are most authentic:\n\n* Virality detection -- using a variety of network graph math and engagement numbers to find conversations and users that are emerging as viral\n* Influence scoring -- algos that see through large follower counts for those users that have the ear of high value people\n* Engagement quality scoring -- algos that see through huge engagement numbers to find the accounts and posts that are getting authentic engagement\n\n  \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMainline DAO and token ecosystem: \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe DAO uses the $MAIN token to drive collection of the most valuable data, process and contextualize it as quickly as possible, offer a free tier that doesn’t require ads, and eventually create a sustainable ecosystem not reliant on centralized infrastructure. \n\nprioritize collection | distribute compute | incentivize human intelligence | decentralize benefit\n\n  \n\n\n*Prioritize collection - Speculator market - Auditors and Brokers*\n\nMainline doesn’t just search social networks– it collects, connects, analyzes, and stores it too. This gets costly really fast, and there’s A LOT of data on social networks– for example just on twitter there’s over hundreds of millions of users generating around 500M tweets per day. How do we prioritize the data we collect? We use the token to introduce market forces to this process– incentivizing holders to accurately predict which topics and trends will attract and be of most interest to paid users of the platform. Brokers speculate on which topic streams will be accessed most, while auditors predict which users and activity will be most important to verify. The latter drives collection of user objects across social, the former of posts. \n\n  \n\n\nIn our open alpha to date, we have collected over 600gb of social data:\n\n* 400,000,000+ users\n* 158,000,000+ posts\n* 20,000,000+ media\n* 9,000,000+ links\n* 2,000,000+ hashtags\n* 260,000,000+ time series data points\n* Billions of interactions\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*HUMINT - Curators*\n\nMachine learning and AI is great at a lot of things, but at present misses important nuances. We incentivize community verifying, labeling and categorizing in MAIN, using a reward multiplier based on quantity and quality of curation. Curation activities include reCAPTCHA-like widgets and tagging users and posts for sentiment, quality, predictions, and more. Anyone can tag elements in the system in the Search and Feed tabs, but only stakers are eligible for Curator rewards. Stake any amount to access the Curator tab and tag to earn. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Distributed data collection and processing - from passive contribution to node operation*\n\nData collection is distributed, with rewards in MAIN to contribute to the process– in the beginning, opting in allows the network to make authenticated API requests on your behalf to process authenticity audits more quickly for everyone. In the future, a master node architecture will fully decentralize data streaming, parsing, analysis, and storage. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Decentralized benefits - Everyone*\n\nSocial media platforms have dramatic expectations for growth and are really expensive to run, and are invariably forced into the ad-model to underwrite their sustainability. Unfortunately, the ad-model has led to the complete degradation of digital interactions by incentivizing manufactured divisiveness, the proliferation of shills and bots, and the amplification of the most outrageous. \n\n  \n\n\nSocial media can be blamed for social polarization, covid disinformation, and the near complete breakdown of political discourse. But it’s also connected and organized the citizenry of the world in profound ways to check the balance of power– from r/wallstreetbets shining light on a rigged system (and making lots of tendies in the process) to global groundswell of support that pressured governments to support Ukraine. \n\n  \n\n\nWe’re not turning back from the connectedness these platforms deliver. And we’re not likely to have a viable alternatives to the OG behemoths– it’s where we already spend our time and have crafted our personas for much of our lives. \n\n  \n\n\nMainline isn’t a social network, and doesn’t aim to replace or compete with existing platforms– it’s aim is to deliver x-ray vision of activity across many social networks, providing a layer of control and visibility where anyone who uses these social platforms can benefit. \n\n  \n\n\nThe data collection and curation driven by the MAIN token builds a massive community-owned database that supports an ongoing free tier including a chrome extension that anyone can use to better navigate social media and break out of the algorithms and echo-chambers.",

As support materials that expand on the information the consultancy sessions will offer.\n2. Serve as a marketing and promotional material to attract and onboard new projects to Cardano.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nJust a few examples of subjects and themes to be covered by the guides:\n\n  \n\n\n* The fact that on Cardano NFTs are actual native tokens, which live on the blockchain at the same level as ADA, not in a smart contract that can be exploited, as we have seen happen repeatedly.\n* The low energy consumption of the Cardano blockchain, which thus has a very low carbon footprint, making it much more environmentally friendly\n* The incredibly low minting costs.\n* The very low transaction fees.\n* The fact that, unlike ETH, Cardano does not experience failed transactions - worst case a tx results in a refund which requires minimal transaction fees.\n* The vibrant and helpful developer community that can assist with technical problems if they were to emerge.\n* The friendly and supportive nature of a large part of the Cardano NFT community.\n* The huge potential for growth of the entire Cardano ecosystem, when compared to ETH. Becoming a part of the ecosystem now will almost surely make you an early adopter.\n* The spirit of innovation and pioneering of the entire Cardano ecosystem that is also manifested in the NFT space.\n* And many more.\n\n  \n\n\nThe consultancy sessions will be on-demand and free of charge for interested projects. Each project will be able to book up to a maximum of 5 sessions over the course of its development.\n\n  \n\n\nWe expect, on average, each project to book 2-3 sessions, our aim is to offer consultancy to 20-25 projects.",

Together with Social app revenue, we fund a professional-grade curriculum for our youth and provide the accompanying Social Technology Stack for Digital Conversations. \n\n  \n\n\nRisk - A new way to approach user interaction.\n\n  \n\n\n Because of the new nature of Story-based Chat Assistants, we need specific knowledge and Motion UI front-end skill. Because Conversational Interaction Design is a new front-end UI approach for Blockchain, but re-imagining pages into conversations simplifies things considerably, because the dependencies are less complex.\n\n  \n\n\n We coordinate with production partners and use our Social R&D tools to learn and build together using the user experience perspective. We are taking away risks because many eyes, expertise, passion, and way of working come together in our Live classes.\n\n \n\n By co-designing with our Partners, the Catalyst, Cardano, and Broader communities, we incorporate honest feedback captured in social design sessions, fine-tuning the design tools and instructional materials even further.\n\n  \n\n\n\n> The best way to learn is to teach and iterate. We consider social design a peer review method for iterative UI design, removing the churn we experience in Catalyst today.\n\n  \n\n\n Risk - Lack of research / live class participants\n\nIn web2 it's often hard to find research candidates or participants, but the web3 community is earger to learn, participate and provide feedback. \n\n  \n\n\nWe concur with the finding of Oliver/IOHK, especially #2 about finding participants.\n\n  \n\n\n\"The community is supercharged!

But our current wallet software separates utility and education, creating barriers for people to enter and trust the crypto space and partake in meaningful use cases.\n\n \n\nCatalyst has its challenges. To effectively work with people you might never have met before, and break out of discovery talks only, we need a new approach to our way of working. \n\n \n\nWe need a new social design approach turns everybody into a designer, unlocking the power of our human potential through cognitive diversity.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n New UX 3.0 method & Social Design Instructors\n\n  \n\n\nLast few years, I designed new Social UX tools that brought me closer to the vision of developing Software that has positive impacts on our daily lives. But I must admit, I have been trying to put this on the Catalyst agenda since Fund2 and resources are running low. Rethinking systems using Design Research takes a lot of time and packaging these outcomes for a larger audience are two different things. That why I ask for your investment to launch the Social Design Academy.\n\n \n\nTo assist people in their Cardano journey, we must upgrade how our Communities and Brands interact with their audiences & clients. We must elevate the repetitive, harsh, static page-based Software using UX 3.0 in which we transition from 'Designing for convenience' to 'Designing for wellbeing' using engaging digital storytelling. Humane software asks people what they need instead of telling them what to do. At Social Design Academy, we are mindful of what we build with Blockchain in our social live classes.\n\n  \n\n\n\"Together, we design a new category of Social Apps that deliver personal and collective development goals using Story-based Chat Assistants. \" - NK.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nWith your investment, Social Design Academy launches a new UX3.0 program that turns communities & brands into forces for good. [Check our SDA budget and roadmap]\n\n  \n\n\nLet's discover these new perspectives together.\n\n  \n\n\n\n> 2 - Your reasons for approaching it in the way that you have;\n\nMost of us have seen the slide in Catalyst Townhall once or twice; \"Catalyst disorients, overloads, and inspires.\" The decentralized nature of the space causes adverse effects, mainly because people don't know where to start or progress, often reaching out to family, friends & Social Media for help.\n\n  \n\n\\*\\*The Functional/ Strategy Perspective\\*\n\n  \n\n\n Page-based interaction design for the web is getting old; we need to rethink the front-end UI for Blockchain to unleash its full potential. Why? Pages are passive and reactive; they don't pro-actively inspire and encourage people to join the Cardano ecosystem.  \n\n \n\nSocial Design Academy focuses on distributed software design (we also call it real social software). Redefining how we build distributed software doesn't happen overnight and needs some serious unlearning and relearning, we develop and streamline what and how we make by capturing design research, having live classes and re-imagening what software can do for us as humans.\n\n \n\nSocial Design Academy believes in coordinating live classes and workshops around distributed software that compounds in a Conversational UI Toolkit leveraging bright minds in the Catalyst, Cardano, and broader software development space. \n\n \n\n By rethinking how we design and develop our front-end and node-systems together, we can not only create a bridge between our web2 and web3 worlds; we make the web fun and meaningful again. By using moral imagination, we deliver true social impact. 🔥  \n\n \n\nEverybody can join collaborative our design workshops, we turn people into civilian design thinkers and doers.\n\n  \n\n\n\n> 3 - Who your project will engage, or who its stakeholders are;\n\nSocial Design Academy is already engaging with the Catalyst & Cardano community daily in our Discord and by having weekly live classes that use these new design tools like; UX reviews, Pain & Gain Personas & Experience mapping. And from July '22 forward we want to intensify our online events.\n\n  \n\n\n Niels Kijf is Social UX Advisor for Consenz and provides the Cardano ecosystem with new design tools to find product-market-fit, of which Emotion Mapping and Pain & Gain are the most effective. Design with emotion, not for emotion, is a core Social Design Principle and simplifies how we connect with our audiences. \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nIn our latest workshop, we concluded that the new Ideascale proposal template triggers anxiety and stress—[Reference 6 - Emotion mapping] Our Proposal Assistant will be an iterative design research to show novel proposal writing processes using the distributed collaboration mindset. [Reference 7 - Design research Chat Assistant for Cardano].\n\n  \n\n\n 'If you don't design with your customer, you are not designing for your customer.'\n\n  \n\n\n To boost our outreach, we coach Social Design Instructors that using Social R&D tools within communities & brands co-create experience maps [Reference 8 - XP map example] that are self-explanatory, stress-free, and meaningful. Together we unlock the true potential of Cardano using our new Social Design tools and Story-based Chat Assistant techniques. \n\n  \n\n\n\n> 4 - How will your project be implemented?\n\n  \n\n\nVisualise to Realise; We can do it!\n\n  \n\n\nCatalyst is missing Iterative Design Circles, UI design groups that engage and encourage blockchain communities with mockups, fresh ideas, and directions by showing UI designs for Digital Governance solutions. Using modern design tools, we get people excited about design, and by asking for feedback on social media, we show people potential directions. \n\n  \n\nIn my almost 25 years of experience as a Digital product designer, people get excited when you show potential approaches and directions in UI design mockups. \n\n  \n\nPeople become creative, asking questions like: \"Is this also possible? Did you think about this?\" This shift the mindset from seeing obstacles to creating a yes-and environment for future design iterations.\n\n  \n\nWe train social UX basics in our live classes [Reference 9 - RSVP Channel] and excite people through loom recordings discussing design. We democratize and humanize our software design, a mission with only winners. [Reference 10 - De-colonize Design thinking.pdf]\n\n  \n\nSocial Design Academy wants to step into the Civilian Design Space using the following Japanese proverb;\n\n  \n\n  Tell people, and they Forget,\n\n  Show people, and they Remember,\n\n  Involve people, and they will Understand.\n\n  \n\n\n\n> 5a - What you will produce (i.e., your outputs)\n\n  \n\n\nMonetize Digital Storytelling\n\n  \n\n\nBy co-designing UX 3.0, together with the Social Design Academy Pitch/Co-investor deck, we engage with Communities & Brands with a new Social Appstore concept. Monetizing Digital Storytelling in new Social Apps outside of the walled gardens will drive adoption for the Cardano Ecosystem, as our world is in desperate need of new hope narratives.\n\n \n\nOur Proposal Assistant will be used as example project in our Live classes. From September onwards we will bring these topics to our live-classes and partners, while I button up F6: In-wallet Onboarding for ADAholder, before Sept 1st, 2022. Learning and building together is our core philosophy, as we believe unlearning and relearning in groups work best.\n\n  \n\n\nWe make Communities & Brands Blockchain Ready™ by introducing a new way of developing their business client interactions using Story Based Chat Assistants. Instead of social media creating our world views, we are transforming our phones into remote controls for our reality. \n\n  \n\n\n Doesn't that sound refreshing?\n\n  \n\nFor our complete approach, check our Budgets, Milestones, and design program, see our SDA budget/roadmap and program spreadsheet.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\nProduction Overview\n\n  \n\n\n Stage A & B - Social UX & Digital Storytelling Workshop | Gitbook Instructional Materials WIP\n\n  \n\n\n  Through Social R&D, we are co-producing two workshops: Social UX & Conversational Interaction Design that redefine how we ideate and co-design real social Software using our distributed software mindset.
