# Tally 
### Offline  
To run the offline tally script we need the committe key and the `active_plans.json` (voteplans encrypted file) to be in the folder where the script is executed. The committee key is generated by the vitup tool togheter with the other backend artifacts, the `active_plans.json` can be retrived from the api with `curl https://{url}/api/v0/vote/active/plans > active_plans.json` We can then run the script passing the voteplan id of the voteplan we want to decrypt `./private.sh 9a278b6f788278e5cd8dfd6de8b8b8699a7f6b4847c680843de6c02d5b3169b2`
