This also helps ensure sustainable impact and a positive return on investment and intention is made.\r\n\r\nBusiness accelerators provide entrepreneurs with: \"a wide range of opportunities for innovation in their industry and an alternative to traditional entrepreneurial education\" (Miller & Bound, 2011).\r\n\r\nHowever this is still an education which too many entrepreneurs miss out on! Meaning many talented engineers and ambitious entrepreneurs alike often struggle to get the resources required just to get started. And too many projects die before they are born!\r\n\r\nThe focus of this challenge should be on developing entrepreneurship skills in:\r\n\r\n\\* entrepreneurial communications  \r\n\\*\\* value proposition design and testing  \r\n\\*\\*\\* financial literacy for business ideation  \r\n\\*\\*\\*\\* measuring sustainable development impacts and growth\r\n\r\nThis could be for developing their technology projects and proposals for (or during) Project Catalyst, the most disruptive business accelerator on the planet today.\r\n\r\nThis challenge seeks novel solutions that equips users with a simple to grasp digital entrepreneurship toolset and knowledge base to apply to their own venture plans. Digital learning, collaboration, and guiding entrepreneurs to self-determine goals and demonstrate learnt skills are all core to this challenge.\r\n\r\nInteraction with Cardano's Treasury system and/or Native Asset Tokens could also play a significant role in basic prototyping or for entrepreneurship education resources to be created and made relevant to decentralised use cases. Though challenge submissions would also accept non-interactive design ideas.\r\n\r\nHowever proposals should ultimately help startups take all the necessary steps to refine perhaps many ideas along the process so they become confident presenters and evaluators of their business' principles, uniqueness, business model, and project objectives.

What use is having the record of ownership on an immutable blockchain, if the work that it points to is no longer accessible? Only the metadata gets stored on the blockchain, if the file it points to is no longer available because the centralised storage it was hosted on is down, the NFT itself loses its value, regardless if it's a piece of digital art, music, or a land lease.  \r\nPicture how the media would cover the story of an NTF artwork that somebody paid hundreds of thousands of dollars suddenly not being there anymore. After an event such as that, storage permanence would surely become the biggest thing the general public would be concerned about. We can anticipate this by building it into the system from the get-go and setting it up as one of the key differentiators because there's a possibility it'll end up being.\r\n\r\n**References:**  \r\nhttps://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/cloud-storage-market-102773  \r\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-storage-a-deep-dive-by-filecoin  \r\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/its-an-nft-boom-do-you-know-where-your-digital-art-lives",

The work should be shared in such a way that a new proposal can continue from what was delivered in the next funding round. Any code should be shared open source\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe proposals have a **max budget** of 5k  \r\nThe idea is that all proposals will be of similar size and should have most of their deliverables ready by the time voting starts. This way voting happens within this campaign purely on which teams managed to add real value to the community\r\n\r\n  \r\n*Reasoning for the budget size:*  \r\n**Proposal budget**  \r\nThe goal is to work in a fixed time scope of 6 weeks and to allow new teams to form.

		"proposal_brief": "Blockchain systems are a complex amalgam of technological, economic and social components that rely and are used by many stakeholders from different geographies and backgrounds. These systems are not isolated from the real world and unexpected threats may emerge from the dynamic interaction.  \r\nCardano stakeholders (users, SPOs, DApp developers, partners, Exchanges, governments, companies) need a resilient system that is able to identify and grade developing threats to its own existence.  \r\nCurrently some aspects of the Cardano system are fully centralized, some are becoming decentralized and some are fully decentralized. Stakeholders currently rely on the expertise of Input Output Global (IOG/IOHK) to provide services under contract to the Cardano ecosystem, but the contract is running out. Many stakeholders hope and desire that IOG will submit a new five-year plan for Cardano's development for funding.  \r\nHowever, even if it materializes as many of us (me included) hope, it will still be good to implement a decentralized threat alert system. Throughout Cardano's history and the history of other blockchains we have seen how threats can emerge slowly.  \r\nWe often see debates about the dozens of network parameters and their impact on stakeholders, delegators, stakepool operators. There are also governance issues, fee issues, network issues for every blockchain. Often economic issues may apepar, competition from other blockchains, taxation issues regarding staking, the size of the blockchain itself. Future issues might appear as the price of a transaction, spamming the blockchain, attempted Sybil attacks, voting blocks by centralized exchanges that try to influence the network in favor of the interests of the exchanges. Etc…  \r\nIn short, life and social and natural environments are unpredictable. The Cardano network may need to implement a decentralized threat alert system - that does not rely on one actor (IOG/Cardano Foundation/Emergo/you name it).  \r\nA simple threat alert system will alert all stakeholders to emerging issues that are increasingly seen as problems for the Cardano blockchain and as such may generate new funding proposals for dealing with them through funding rounds on Catalyst.  \r\nThink of it as the eyes and ears. In evolutionary biology, it was not by chance that eyes and ears and senses evolved on the front part of animal bodies, as they were the ones that were the first to enter new environments and needed to sense a threat before the threat overcame the system.  \r\nWe need a simple threat alert mechanism to warn us about a not so visible threat that is gaining power and speed. Think of a carbon monoxide alarm. Simple detector for an invisible threat that is building up. Cheap, efficient - and invaluable. That is what this Challenge could lead to.  \r\nStakeholders are the eyes and ears of Cardano. They just need a way of communicating what they are perceiving, so that the feedback can return back to the system. Then it can be dealt with through the existing Catalyst mechanisms and the entire Voltaire structure that is being developed.  \r\nNot all users can detect all threats to be sure. However, the Cardano ecosystem is becoming more diverse in terms of composition, roles, geographic displacement, technical capabilities, personal experience.  \r\nSome threats will be detected by stakepool operators, some will be detected by users, some might be first seen by developers, while other threats will be detected by participants in Project Catalyst.  \r\n  \r\n**Some examples of systemic threats that have not been identified or dealt with in other blockchain systems and which may jeopardize their ultimate survival or success are given below and some general threats.**  \r\nI'm including a Cardano related threat that has been resolved, number 7 - just to illustrate that our ecosystem has not been immune to problems.\r\n\r\n1.  growing mining centralization in Bitcoin (BTC)\r\n2.  unsustainable gas fees in Ethereum, delays in protocol changes, staking issues (ETH)\r\n3.  alleged non-compliance with securities legislation in US (XRP)\r\n4.  inability to agree on a mechanism to fund ongoing developments or setup a treasury (ETC)\r\n5.  51% attacks and rearrangement of blocks (ETC)\r\n6.  Founder abandonment risk - when founder leaves (EOS)\r\n7.  Unexpected problems inside one of the key ecosystem partners (ADA) - this refers to the period when the Cardano Foundation was headed by its previous chairman and executive director Michael Parsons, which was widely seen by the Cardano community as a dysfunctional period for the Cardano Foundation\r\n8.  Stagnation in evolving the protocol and onboarding new developments (BTC)\r\n9.  Threats from proliferation of blockchain clones - think Bitcoin clones Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin SV (BSV), Bitcoin Gold (BTG), Bitcoin Diamond (BCD).\r\n10.  Ongoing scams and crypto phishing attempts are evolving. The more successful Cardano becomes, the more it may be unwillingly associated with scams - in the eyes of users who fall prey to these scammers, leading to negative publicity.\r\n11.  Sybil behavior in evidence. Proliferation of stakepools held by one owner and the consequent increased leverage of such stakepools on the Cardano ecosystem. For example, major centralized exchanges and some pool operators are setting up dozens and dozens of stakepools with the consequent right to have an outsized influence on the future of the Cardano blockchain. \"The higher the leverage of the system, the worse its security (to see this, consider that with leverage above 50, launching a 51% attack requires a mere 1% of the total resources!)\"\\*\\* according to IOHK (ADA)\r\n12.  An unexpected or gradual collapse of one of the key partners in the Cardano ecosystem (IOG/Cardano Foundation/Emurgo) - could happen, although we all hope it won't\r\n13.  You name it … it hasn't occurred yet, but someone in our ecosystem is already noticing it and wants to warn us about it  \r\n    \\*\\* https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/11/13/the-general-perspective-on-staking-in-cardano/  \r\n    **Important note: This is a Fund6 Challenge Setting proposal - for a future challenge in Fund 6. This means I am not personally applying for funding in this challenge! The proposed budget of USD50,000 would go to fund proposals developed by future proposers in Fund 6 who would apply to find solutions to this challenge. I have no proposed solutions nor am I suggesting the best way of addressing this Challenge it will be up to proposers in Fund 6, if this is selected as a future Challenge.**",
