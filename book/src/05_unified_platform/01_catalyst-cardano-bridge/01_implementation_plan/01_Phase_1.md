# Phase 1

Basic chain sync

Features:

1. Node 2 Client protocol syncing from local blockchain client
2. Sync starts from genesis
3. Dumps raw block information to the console as soon as each block is received.

## Deliverables

A test version that can do all of the above.

## Result

Allows us to test how fast the Node 2 Client protocol can retrieve blockchain data against a locally fully synced node.
