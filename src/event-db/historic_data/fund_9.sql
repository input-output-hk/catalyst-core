    '{"brief": "Background\n\n  \n\n\nHydra development has progressed to a point where it is possible for developers to test the technology as a Cardano Layer 2 scalability solution. As such, early engagement by the developer community is key to both:\n\n* Driving the Hydra roadmap going forward to ensure its focus on enabling and enhancing real world business models being built on Cardano\n* Building tooling, documentation, and content to lower the barrier to getting started for developing Hydra-ready solutions\n\n  \n\n\nThis challenge, proposed by IOG, serves to direct development priorities towards uncovering, analyzing, and validating new Hydra-enabled business models, as well as to improve the experience of developing DApps that will rely on Hydra.\n\n  \n\n\nBrief\n\nHydra head protocol is an isomorphic multi-party state channel for Cardano and a layer 2 scalability solution to speed up transaction processing by decreasing latency when validating transactions, increasing transaction throughput, and minimizing transaction cost. Services built directly on the Cardano ledger can be designed to use Hydra head instead for transaction processing, in order to both benefit from these advantages and to reduce the network load on the Cardano ledger.\n\n  \n\n\nAs a layer 2 solution, Hydra compromises neither in terms of safety, nor in terms of expressiveness and reusability of scripting, since it inherits both the security properties and (being largely isomorphic) scripting capabilities of Cardano layer 1. It also allows service providers on Cardano the flexibility to set their own custom protocol parameters, which in turns makes it possible to e.g. set lower transaction and script execution fees, as well as faster processing of transactions with scripts (including processing of more complex scripts) by freely adjusting the time budget for computing resources like CPU and memory.\n\n  \n\n\nThe community should have more stake in driving the Hydra roadmap, by encouraging more developer activity in interacting with the Hydra head protocol, as the initial component of the Hydra technology, during its development stage. This developer activity can take form of analyzing and validating scenarios that can take advantage of early iterations of Hydra technology (think case studies, design patterns, reference implementations of relevant use cases), as well as building tools and creating content to improve the experience of both developing Hydra-based applications and operating related infrastructure (think developer documentation, SDKs, training content, and services such as managed Hydra head/node).\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n Guiding Questions\n\n* Which concrete scalability challenges faced by specific use cases in the Cardano DApp ecosystem can be overcome by the initial implementation of the Hydra head protocol, as outlined in the research paper?\n* What would a potential solution look like?\n* Which new business models are enabled and how?\n* Which challenges will developers face when trying to adapt existing layer 1 DApps or build new DApps using the Hydra head protocol? What can be done to overcome these challenges?\n* Which challenges will service providers face when operating a service relying on the Hydra head protocol?\u00a0 What can be done to overcome these challenges?\n* What is the impact on the end user experience when using a layer 2 state channel based solution such as Hydra? How can it be improved?\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n Inspirational Potential Directions\u00a0\n\n* Case studies, models, and reference implementations of business models/use cases in the following areas\n* Payments (e.g. tipping, pay-per-use APIs, micropayments, in-game/in-app payments, e-commerce integrations)\n* DeFi (e.g. DEX protocols, incl. swaps, order book matching, decentralized oracle feeds)\n* Governance (e.g. voting)\n* NFTs (auctions, drops)\n* Any other use case proposals\n* Tools for developers and infrastructure operators\n* Reusable frameworks and SDKs for Hydra node\n* Managed Hydra head service (custodial)\n* Tutorials and education material\n* Logging, monitoring, benchmarking and testing tools\n* Integration with (light) wallets\n\n  \n\n\nWhat does success look like?\n\n* Hydra implementation and roadmap reflect developer needs and support scalable real world business models on Cardano\n* Developers have resources needed to integrate Hydra into their applications (e.g developer tools and frameworks, example applications, case studies, documentation, training content)\n* Improved understanding of business models and scenarios that can benefit from the Hydra technology framework, starting with the Hydra head protocol and matching the Hydra roadmap beyond it\n* Developer community on Cardano is engaged and actively contributing to the core Hydra technology stack and supporting tools, frameworks, and documentation\n* Commercial solutions using Hydra head protocol deployed in the Cardano mainnet\n\n  \n\n\nResources\n\nHydra Head research paper: https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/hydrafast-isomorphic-state-channels/\n\nHydra Head documentation: https://hydra.family/head-protocol/\n\nHydra Head roadmap: https://github.com/orgs/input-output-hk/projects/21/views/7\n\nHydra Head github repo: https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra-poc\n\nHydra head example application (a game of rock-paper-scissors): COMING SOON", "importance": "Hydra has progressed where it is now possible for developers to test Cardano''s L2 scalability solution and dev community engagement is key", "goal": "* Hydra roadmap reflects developer needs to support scalable real world uses\n* Devs have resources to integrate Hydra into their applications", "metrics": "* Number of project proposals based on this challenge setting\n* # of dev projects started/approved/funded/completed, including training content, documentation, developer tools, example applications\n* # of discussions about the challenge in comms channels (discord and other)\n* # of feature requests to Hydra roadmap\n* # of Hydra heads deployed in testnet/mainnet (and local devnets/Hydra nodes setup)\n* traffic in deployed Hydra heads in testnet/mainnet\n* # of activity on github repo: views, feature requests, discussion posts/questions/comments, downloads"}', -- extra

The SDK formalises much of one\u2019s interaction with Cardano, giving developers a quality foundation that reduces implementation subjectivity and complexity. Delivering such a toolset will start to make the developer experience a joy and help developers (of all experiences) build on Cardano. The community knows best what steps are required to build their visions, that\u2019s why it''s important any on-boarding platform should be led by the community.

We need a wider selection of tooling that is inclusive, fuss-free to set up, and most importantly, allows for the dApp to seamlessly scale. We also desire to offer multi-language support, to be inclusive of developers whose native language is not Haskell, and to drive adoption amongst larger developer ecosystems.\n\n  \n\n\nThe Plutus Challenge invites the community to build tools that make the developer experience of building dApps and smart contracts on Cardano 100x more awesome. Developer tools, platforms to significantly reduce the time it takes to go from zero to hero while building and deploying dApps, and products to boost developer adoption. It should be possible for an otherwise experienced engineer to come to a 2-day hackathon and build a baseline prototype dApp, test it, and iterate on it.\n\n  \n\n\nIOG submits this challenge proposal to ensure that necessary resources are available for the community to help realise this vision. \n\n  \n\n\nAdditional success criteria\n\n  \n\n\nA multitude of teams in the Cardano ecosystem are building their own custom tooling. This can make for challenging redundancy,\u00a0if new entrants to the ecosystem have to build their own new tools time and again.

These samples will be used as a template for building more complex applications.\n* Developer tools are open-sourced.\n\n  \n\n\nGuiding questions\n\n* What aspects of development are underserved by existing tooling?\n* How can developers get up and running effortlessly to start building dApps?\n* How can we decrease the time it takes to set up development environments?\n* What prerequisites and costs does a developer need to enter the ecosystem? How can we lower these? How does an otherwise experienced developer enter this ecosystem, if their background is not in Haskell?\n* What does the end to end development process of creating a dApp look like?\n* How can we improve the process of debugging a smart contract script?\n* How can we provide a seamless way for developers to interact with external tooling and integrations? Can we provide these tools as-a-service?\n* What key pieces of developer infrastructure are missing?

    '{"brief": "Marlowe\u2019s roadmap has entered a phase in which it is moving from technology-driven development to user-driven development. This requires a community of pioneers, early adopters, power users and builders to contribute to:\u00a0\n\n* Building open tooling, expanding Marlowe\u2019s compatibility, documentation and tutorials for making it even easier to build smart contracts\n* Feeding into the roadmap to gear Marlowe\u2019s domain-specific language (DSL) and suite of products to enable the creation and experimentation of real-world use-cases that go beyond what we see in the cryptosphere today\n\n  \n\n\nThis Marlowe challenge aims to reveal community and developer priorities, business models, functional and non-functional requirements that catalyze the adoption of Marlowe smart contracts within the Cardano ecosystem. This doesn\u2019t need to be limited to solely the Cardano blockchain, it could lend itself to sidechains, cross-chain capabilities, or even development of novel approaches for Cardano.\n\n  \n\n\nRight now it\u2019s extremely difficult to experiment with smart contracts let alone come up with real world applications.\u00a0We know that low code solutions to create or implement smart contracts are just not mature enough. The complexity of transposing real-world processes and use cases onto smart contracts is hard to conceive owing, in part, to a lack of supportive tooling.\u00a0IOG submits this challenge to focus resources towards this priority area.\n\n  \n\n\nWe need to reduce the burden on creating software so that builders (whether financial engineers or DApp developers) can focus on business logic and policies. This will help us create bridges between the worlds of DeFi, TradFi and RealFi while also enabling experimentation within these worlds.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThere are several safety requisites and additional components that are required for all realistic applications in any domain. For now, there is a lack of standards which increases the disjointedness of the efforts. Marlowe paves the way to providing audits, proofs, simulations and static analysis as built-ins and would like to support standards in the future as well with, for instance, ACTUS contracts and other reference implementations.\n\n  \n\n\nGuiding Questions\n\n* What are the main challenges developers and builders will face when trying to integrate Marlowe smart contracts into existing solutions? How can we make it easier for them to surmount these?\n* What are some of the key tools, components or libraries that will encourage the adoption of Marlowe smart contracts?\n* What compatibility issues will service providers, institutions or applications face when attempting to design Marlowe-powered solutions? What can be done to address these issues?\n* How can we enhance the flow of creating and deploying Marlowe contracts within existing or new interfaces?\n* How could Marlowe be used for social/economic impact, addressing financial inequality or in general creating more equitable RealFi infrastructure?\n\n  \n\n\nInspirational Potential Directions\u00a0\n\n* Interfaces to Marlowe compatibilities\n* E.g. Python library, SDK, or APIs\n* Open tooling for developers, builders and pioneers\n* Debugger\n* Marlowe-aware exploration of the blockchain\n* Rendering contracts as diagrams or text\n* Offline tooling beyond Marlowe playground\n* Standalone Simulator and static analysis tools for any contract\n* Tutorials or educational material\n* Wallet integrations\n\n  \n\n\n* Running real-world Marlowe contracts (case studies, business models, use-cases and reference implementations)\n* Marlowe for DApps for example, but not limited to\n* Finance (DeFi, TradFi, RealFi \u2013 complex financial instruments \u2013 derivatives, lending, payments, settlements, oracle feeds, governance, micropayments)\n* NFTs \u2013 novel use of the concept\n* Real-estate or property related\n* Legal contracts\n* Any other use cases are welcomed\n* Djed or stable coin integration\n* Requirements, development, integration and use of oracles\n* Documentation and tutorials for token minting and contracts\n* Any other ideas are welcome\n\n  \n\n\nAdditional success critera\n\n* This community is diverse, value-driven and empowered to work on the wicked problems that are long standing in the crypto and blockchain world \u2013 namely, real world application with safeguards.\n* Marlowe\u2019s roadmap is user-driven and supports scalable business models.\n* Developers and creators have the necessary resources off-the-shelf to create and deploy Marlowe smart contracts on Marlowe Apps or their own DApps.\n* Builders can easily focus on business logic of real-world processes while transposing them onto smart contract logic.\n* Commercial solutions using Marlowe smart contracts are encouraged to begin\u00a0deployment", "importance": "Smart contracts are fundamental to real world use-cases of blockchain.

    '{"brief": "Our latest challenge takes everything we have learned from our 500+ Atala PRISM Pioneers, Catalyst Funded Projects, and insights gained working with Trust and Governance Frameworks. We are revisiting our prior challenge themes and building upon them with an additional challenge: solve the business coordination and stakeholder challenge in parallel with the technology implementation effort.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMaking the technology compatible and user-friendly is only half of the effort required in the mass adoption of blockchain technology; we must also be able to meet with and relay the information to the stakeholders and businesses that are involved. There are requirements for developing this technology for business uses, but other business-specific considerations to promote these systems for further and more inclusive uses include: creating incentives, interoperability, unlocking positive impact, and streamlining coordination in a decentralized ecosystem.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe increased focus comes from a growing understanding that identity is the key to the mass adoption of blockchain technology while adding value to layer-1. The evidence is in the recent marketing announcement of \"Web5,\" as well as the recent white paper considering Soul-Bound Tokens.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis challenge is to identify targeted stakeholders within the product concept, allocate funds for the developers to converse with stakeholders, convene or join a working group (i.e., Governance Framework Working Group at ToIP), consider and analyze a structured ecosystem, publish a report, and work on the next steps to develop the next feature of the intended project.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis challenge will sound familiar to anyone who has been through our Pioneer Program and is actively working on an SSI project. Convening the stakeholders of your ecosystem to talk through details of interoperability, credential schemas, and technology gaps is the key to any SSI project''s success.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nPlease review our challenge from Fund 7 to see the examples of the types of use cases in which we are interested. Do not let these limit your imagination. We are excited to see new projects and to encourage all projects to consider the critical importance of funding ecosystem development activities.\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68xgX\\_cNIHI", "importance": "Establishing a representative stakeholders working group for a decentralized ecosystem speeds up learning and building the right solutions.", "goal": "Establish key relationships and learnings early in the development cycle, leading to faster and more successful business outcomes.", "metrics": "In addition to having a great team, product roadmap, milestones, and execution plan we look for successful proposers to execute the following as part of the business plan:\n\n  \n\n\n* Complete the Atala PRISM Pioneer Program\n* Complete a Governance Framework workshop with IOG PSG team\n* Establish or join a Governance Framework working group at Trust over IP, or another host organization.\n* Identify stakeholders including issuers, holders, verifiers, policy makers, and their business requirements\n* Establish a cadence of meetings and contribution and convene a home for parties to adopt and participate in the Ecosystem and Ecosystem Governance\n* Progress towards publishing a Governance Framework\n* Develop a Proof of Concept, Pilot, or commercial launch"}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "In the past, for many reasons, Vietnam was often behind the world in technology. But for now, the miraculous growth of Blockchain technology has attracted more and more Vietnamese to join this field. Vietnam is a big country in Southeast Asia with great potential for research, development, and adoption of Information Technology, Blockchain, and Cryptocurrency in real life. However, there are thousands of projects created with the aim of defrauding new investors who do not have a full understanding of blockchain. So I hope that Vietnamese people will have a place to connect, share with each other, and find good projects so as not to make unfortunate mistakes. Cardano has become one of the fastest-growing blockchain projects in the crypto industry, attracting the attention of many Vietnamese investors. Therefore, we believe it is necessary to promote and expand the Cardano and Project Catalyst ecosystem in Vietnam today. In this challenge, we are providing funding to people who have been learning about Cardano to take advantage of the community support and build or use the Cardano network.\n\n  \n\n\n*Why this category is important*\n\n  \n\n\nSince fund 7, the number of proposals from Vietnam has increased incredibly. It means that Cardano is being strongly attracted by the Vietnamese community. There are already some members who have activated positively in the community.\n\nThere are some typical high-value projects that have been funded and are strong growing. Scale-up community projects:\n\n* FIMI project\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/385088\u00a0\n\n* Catalyst2VN project\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/382651\u00a0\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/382591\u00a0\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/382615\u00a0\n\n* VCoincheck project\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/381388\u00a0\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/397463\u00a0\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/397460\u00a0\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/397456\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404213\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nAnd application projects:\n\n* BWORKs project\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/404580\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/397164\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/397690\n\n* IRONSKY Project\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/383932\u00a0\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/399208\u00a0\n\n* BlockTree project\n\nhttps://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/396832\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nBut the participation in the Catalyst is still rarely relatively low compared to its potential in the current market. Given the current momentum, setting a challenge in fund 10 is likely to show good engagement and possibly strengthen the Vietnamese community.\n\n  \n\n\n*Guiding Questions*\n\n  \n\n\n* How can we create more content about Cardano that will bring more engagement from people outside Blockchain ecosystems?\n* How can we better support proposers coming to our ecosystem?\n* How can we support the community to create more engagement in promoting Cardano?\n\n  \n\n\n*Recommendations can focus on the following points:*\n\n  \n\n\n* Create educational content about Cardano & Catalyst in Vietnamese (by creating archives, video, and audio assets)\n* Awareness campaigns as events (online or offline)\n* Create a community hub or Cardano-centric group\n* Build easily accessible community platforms\n\n  \n\n\n*Budget explanation*\n\n  \n\n\n\n> We estimate 1ADA = 0.5$ (current price)\n\nThe budget was set at 150,000ADA because the challenge focused on only a specific section of the community. We set a maximum budget limit of 15,000ADA per project. In addition, projects from Vietnam have wide applications and will be suitable for other challenges.\n\n(We need more than 150,000ADA but we will consider this proposal as a stepping stone. If this challenge succeeds, we will most likely come back with other challenges)", "importance": "From fund7, the number of Vietnamese proposals has increased significantly.

    '{"brief": "https://youtu.be/YUFqamr78Xk  \n\n\n  \n\n\nWhat is education for sustainable development (ESD)?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nESD gives learners of all ages the knowledge, skills, values and agency to address interconnected global challenges including climate change, loss of biodiversity, unsustainable use of resources, and inequality. It empowers learners of all ages to make informed decisions and take individual and collective action to change society and care for the planet. ESD is a lifelong learning process and an integral part of quality education. It enhances the cognitive, socio-emotional and behavioural dimensions of learning and encompasses learning content and outcomes, pedagogy and the learning environment itself.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nESD is a key driver for achieving all SDGs.\n\n\u00a0\n\nContext:\n\n  \n\n\nUNESCO\u2019s recent report *Learn for our Planet* (2021) shows that despite progress from many governments in integrating sustainability within the education system, much more needs to be done. The research looking at the extent to which environmental issues are integrated into primary and secondary education policies and curricula in nearly 50 UNESCO Member states includes the findings that over half of education policies and curricula studied made no mention of climate change.\n\n  \n\n\nIt is increasingly recognized that education and learning [Formal and non-formal education, as well as informal learning] are crucial for addressing the climate emergency.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nEducation can aim to teach us to live harmoniously within our planetary boundaries, as a part of a shared ecosystem.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nEducation for Sustainable Development reorients education to empower learners of all ages to act for environmental integrity, economic viability, and a more equitable society.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nEducation for Sustainable Development has been recognized to have the power to make progress across a wide range of sustainable development challenges and specifically across all of the 2030 Agenda\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals by the UN General Assembly in 2017.\n\n  \n\n\nEducation in our contemporary world is expected to instill the set of knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes in lifelong learners to thrive in increasingly diverse and rapidly changing societies and labour markets, but also impart them with a moral compass, purpose and meaning, which contribute to individual and collective well-being.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nIt must equip them with essential \u2018transversal\u2019 competencies, such as critical thinking, creativity, empathy, collaborative problem-solving and systems thinking to become change agents to transform our societies for the betterment of all people and the planet as responsible citizens of the global community.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nIt would then allow learners to learn about and shape who they are and what they want to be; to feel connected to their heritage, remain open to other ways of being and willing to learn throughout life.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nUNESCO has been promoting the transformative power of education since its creation, guided by, among others, the 1974 Recommendation concerning Education for International Understanding, Co-operation and Peace and Education relating to Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as well as Sustainable Development Goal Target 4.7:\n\n  \n\n\n* 4.7 by 2030 ensure all learners acquire knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including among others through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship, and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture\u2019s contribution to sustainable development\n\n  \n\n\nFor UNESCO, *transformative education* involves the teaching and learning geared to motivate and empower learners to take informed decisions and actions at the individual, community and global levels. This notably implies ensuring, for instance, the curriculum, pedagogy, learning materials, schools, or learning environments are meaningful in the natural, political, economic and cultural contexts.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nImportantly, education can only be \u201c*transformative\u201d* when learners feel valued, acknowledged, safe and are included in the learning community as full and active members.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nEducation has to model the world, values and behaviours that we expect from children and the architects of the future. Educators are expected to transform their teaching into something that speaks to learners, not just something that is talked about. Learners must then engage with the world and encounter it in ways that command attention and become significant.\n\n  \n\n\nTeachers, Trainers and Educators play a crucial role in promoting the acquisition of skills, competencies and values to empower learners to become change agents in support of sustainable societies. This entails the appropriate training and capacity building provision for teachers and trainers to facilitate this transition. Project Catalyst with the support of the Cardano Community can direct the necessary resources towards projects that seek to close the gaps in our societies and demonstrate to the world that Cardano and its community is THE #Blockchain4Good.\n\n  \n\n\nOur goal:\n\n  \n\n\nScale up the contribution of Cardano and its impactful community by highlighting and elevating the role of education and learning in solving local and global problems. Problems such as climate change. Project Catalyst can help change makers develop and implement solutions that ensure all learners acquire knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to tackle the climate crisis and the wicked problems that remain endemic in our societies.\n\n  \n\n\nHow can I get involved?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEvery single person can take action in many different ways every day to ensure we have a planet, a home, that sustainably allows us all to thrive, flourish and prosper. Submitting a proposal, getting funding and support via this Challenge Category is step in that direction.\n\n  \n\n\nESD for 2030 toolbox: priority action areas\n\n  \n\n\nThe ESD for 2030 roadmap outlines actions in five priority action areas on policy, learning environments, building capacities of educators, youth and local level action, stressing further ESD\u2019s key role for the successful achievement of the 17 SDGs and the great individual and societal transformation required to address the urgent sustainability challenges.\n\n  \n\n\nThis toolbox provides an evolving set of selected resources to support Member States, regional and global stakeholders to develop activities in support of the five priority action areas and of the six key areas of implementation (country initiatives, ESD network, communication & advocacy, issues & trends, resource mobilization, monitoring).\n\n  \n\n\nUNESCO\u2019s ESD toolkit to support proposers along 5 priority action areas:\n\n1.

The impactful could be seen as a cliff fall right after the event.\n\n  \n\n\n* With the continued support from Eastern Hemisphere Town Hall Team on bi-weekly meetings. We can see a number of blockchain coders from other ecosystems are keen to explore Cardano programming languages such as Plutus, Marlowe, and Glow.\n\n  \n\n\n* Existing blockchains are delivering and maximizing their branding awareness to communities. We believe that the current promotion and expansion of the Cardano ecosystem and Project Catalyst in Vietnam are inadequate and need to grow at least equal to other blockchains or faster.\n\n  \n\n\n* As a permissionless and trustless blockchain, the participants did not require a certain language as a protocol to communicate between the wallets or Dapps. However, to expand Cardano to a wider community as non-native English speakers would be facing a certain difficulty degree.\u00a0 Therefore, this challenge may not only help the Vietnamese community but can be a sample groundwork for other communities wishing to expand the Cardano ecosystem in their own communities faster and stabilize.\n\n  \n\n\n* To grow sustainably, maintain a high level of Cardano in community joining. We believe this challenge would create mass awareness in the community, and possibly some government agencies would be involved soon. Regardless whichever signs or endorsement is happening would give Cardano blockchain a certain degree of wider recognition and adoption than at present.", "importance": "The number of Vietnamese proposals rose sharply in recent funds, this challenge necessitates growth in multiple dimensions in Vietnam.", "goal": "Success is having multiple submissions in Fund10 for designs based in Viet Nam, which have a massive impact on the Cardano ecosystem.", "metrics": "The overall key metrics would be:\n\n  \n\n\n* A number of proposals address the obvious problems preventing Cardano adoption in Vietnam.\n* a number of proposals tackling infrastructure and education concerns\n* Number of new Cardano users from Viet Nam (wallets, platform sign-ups)\n* Number of new Catalyst members from Viet Nam (proposers, voters, CAs)\n* The number of new Viet Nam projects that will be launched in 2022.\n* Increase interaction between Catalyst and Viet Nam-focused projects.\n* Engage between the government agencies and legislative bodies with the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem."}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "This is a challenge that helps Projects on their mission to demonstrate that Cardano can allocate resources aligned with a specific interest or greater good which has been neglected by the traditional System for decades now. The best way to fight greenhouse gasses is by reducing energy-consumption. But this is not enough, we need to make the Cardano ecosystem Climate Positive; if achieved, the World will be a more regenerative, better place. We should incentivize that with at least a small % of our collective Potential.\n\n  \n\n\nWhat began as a challenge, has turned into a community: Cardano4Climate\n\n  \n\n\nWhile holding weekly meetups for 6 month now we have engaged with many different proposers and projects. Last funding round as a community, we have identified [1]many proposals already that were closely related to this challenge and we invited many more to the [2]sustainability event that we hold continuously now.\n\n  \n\n\nWhen talking about the fundamentals of Climate Change itself we would like to encourage you to read up on the papers and the official reports. We specifically refer to the [3]IPCC reports (we also linked a shorter and easier to read press-release in the links section):\n\n  \n\n\n\"GENEVA, Aug 9 \u2013 Scientists are observing changes in the Earth''s climate in every region and across the whole climate system, according to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report, released today. Many of the changes observed in the climate are unprecedented in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years, and some of the changes already set in motion\u2014such as continued sea level rise\u2014are irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years.\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"The report projects that in the coming decades climate changes will increase in all regions. For 1.5\u00b0C of global warming, there will be increasing heat waves, longer warm seasons and shorter cold seasons. At 2\u00b0C of global warming, heat extremes would more often reach critical tolerance thresholds for agriculture and health, the report shows.\"\n\n  \n\n\n\"Stabilizing the climate will require strong, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and reaching net zero CO2 emissions. Limiting other greenhouse gasses and air pollutants, especially methane, could have benefits both for health and the climate\"\n\n  \n\n\nHow will this challenge provide a springboard for Cardano adoption?\n\n  \n\n\nThe green-movement is bigger than ever and companies like Tesla are immensely popular and successful not because they make cars that accelerate faster, but because their electric and therefore environmentally friendly cars are clearly one very important piece of the puzzle when it comes to preventing climate change. If we had to take a wild guess as to what one of the other pieces of the puzzle could be, we would propose looking into better governance systems for example. By having experiments on the topic of climate change, not only will Catalyst contribute to preventing climate change but also position Cardano as the green blockchain of the future and hopefully Catalyst will learn about how to deal with such urgent and tough problems.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nHow will this challenge advance Cardano''s mission?\n\n  \n\n\nIf we can''t build Systems that are better than our traditional Systems, what are we doing here? We could go back to central banks and governing classes. How to better prove that Cardano is a worthwhile endeavor to the young, the governments, the people than by showing our commitment and contribution to the environment.\n\n  \n\n\nGuiding questions\n\n  \n\n\nWhat will have the greatest impact on climate change in the short and long term?\n\n  \n\n\nWhat real-world regenerative solutions already exist that would benefit from applications developed on the Cardano blockchain now, and in the near future?\n\n  \n\n\nHow can we incentivize individuals, local communities, councils and municipal authorities, businesses and governments to prioritize taking action to reduce our overall greenhouse gas footprint?\n\n  \n\n\nWhat are the most useful and scalable applications to put Cardano at the forefront of real, actionable solutions which reduce the greenhouse gasses we will pass on to future generations?\n\n  \n\n\nHow can we minimize Cardano''s greenhouse gasses further or even become Climate positive?\n\n  \n\n\nProposal success metrics:\n\n  \n\n\nHow big is the impact on Cardano''s self-sustainability?\n\n  \n\n\nHow big is the impact on greenhouse gasses (Co2, \u2026)?\n\n  \n\n\nHow big is the impact on regenerating our planet?\n\n  \n\n\nHow big is the awareness that will be created?\n\n  \n\n\nIs your proposal financially sustainable after funding?\n\n  \n\n\nBudget rationale\n\n  \n\n\nObviously this is not a Climate Fund, but having a small percentage being used for exploration on how Cardano can help solve this wicket problem is really the minimum we can do given the urgency of the issue now and the long time it took for it to finally be recognized by the mainstream.\n\n  \n\n\nLinks\n\n  \n\n\nJoin our Community!\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/Cardano4Climate\n\n  \n\n\nPress release on IPCC-report:\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr/\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/climate-change/\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nReferences\n\n  \n\n\n[1] https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w89O\\_6R-sqd9WmCTttdaUtwAenckJlZt1nJT2LmatQY/edit#gid=0\n\n  \n\n\n[2] https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Cardano-Catalyst-Community-Network/events/jqqjqsyccqbtb\n\n  \n\n\n[3] https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1", "importance": "Legacy systems have failed us on climate change!

Funding categories if fully adopted can remove the issues and inefficiencies surrounding challenge settings.\n\n  \n\n\nFunding categorisation has a number of properties that can be analysed. Categorisation can be broad or specific, inclusive or exclusive and recurring or changing. Funding categories have been created based off the properties which are more effective for funding categorisation. Funding categories focus on being broad, inclusive and recurring - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis/categorisation-properties\n\n  \n\n\nUsing more effective categorisation properties results in a number of advantages. Funding categories offer a more efficient, simple, flexible, scalable and egalitarian approach to do funding categorisation than challenge settings. Funding categories are effective for directing funding and also help to increase healthy competition - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis/funding-categories-advantages/overview\n\n  \n\n\nFunding categories achieve similar or often better outcomes than challenge settings for ensuring each focus area has access to funding in a given funding round - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis/historical-analysis-and-comparisons/funding-access-for-each-focus-area\n\n  \n\n\nFunding categories provide a 80% total cost reduction when used as a replacement to challenge settings.

A weighted average percentage is then achieved from the voting results. This percentage is then converted into the equivalent ADA value that will be requested for that funding category from the total amount of funding that will be available in the next round.\n\n  \n\n\nTo register and participate in the budget weighting vote you can find all of the details in this funding categories documentation - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/catalyst-funding-categories/budget-weighting-votes/fund-9\n\n  \n\n\n\u2014-\n\n  \n\n\nPurpose\n\n  \n\n\nThis proposal represents a way for the community to vote for the full usage of funding categories for the next funding round.\n\n  \n\n\nWhats included?\n\n  \n\n\nThis proposal includes all of the funding categories. Funding categories cover all forms of idea and innovation and also introduce a full time contributor model.\n\n  \n\n\nFull list of funding categories and the budgets that would be used:\n\n* Community & Outreach - 1,800,000 ADA\n* Products & Integrations - 3,000,000 ADA\n* Governance & Identity - 2,000,000 ADA\n* Development & Infrastructure - 2,925,000 ADA\n* Nurturing Ideas & Teams - 1,000,000 ADA\n* Catalyst Contributors - 1,100,000 ADA\n* Cardano Contributors - 975,000 ADA\n\n  \n\n\nThe budgets for the categories were determined using a democratic community vote prior to proposal finalisation.\n\n  \n\n\nHow will it work?\n\n  \n\n\nIf this proposal is selected then there will be seven funding categories for the community to submit proposals into for the next funding round.\n\n  \n\n\nFunding categories will have a budget weighting applied to them that is from the results of the budget weighting vote - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/catalyst-funding-categories/budget-weighting-votes/fund-9\n\n  \n\n\nWho\u2019s on the team?\n\n  \n\n\nCurrently challenge teams are used for the challenge settings when they are voted in. Funding categories are simply a model to improve funding categorisation. Anyone in the community is welcome to join as a challenge team member for any of the funding categories that get selected to be used in the next funding round. Challenge teams are not fully formed at the point of proposal submission.\n\n  \n\n\nAre there any risks?\n\n  \n\n\nNo. Only one of two outcomes can come from this proposal. The first is this proposal is selected, meaning it must come first in the voting process, and means that funding categories will be used in full for the next funding round. The second outcome is that the proposal does not come first then the remaining challenge setting proposals will compete for access to the available funds.\n\n  \n\n\nVoting considerations\n\n  \n\n\nFunding categories provide a more simple, effective, cost reduced, efficient and egalitarian approach to funding categorisation. There are a number of advantages of using funding categories over challenge settings - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis/funding-categories-advantages/overview\n\n  \n\n\nVoters who have read the funding categories analysis and want to see funding categories replace challenge settings can consider the following choices for the upcoming vote:\n\n  \n\n\n* To increase the chance that funding categories are used in the next funding round the voter can upvote this full fund proposal as well as all the funding category proposals.\n* To maximise the chance of funding categories being used then voters can also optionally downvote all proposals that are not funding categories.\n\n  \n\n\nFeedback\n\n  \n\n\nIf you have any feedback or concerns regarding this proposal please feel free to reach out to us in a dedicated Telegram for funding categories discussion - https://t.me/catalystfundingcategories", "importance": "Challenge settings are not effective for funding categorisation.

Contributor roles within the Cardano ecosystem currently include developers, coordinators and analysts that focus on the improvement of the development ecosystem and ease of stake pool operation. The contributors can be seen as a glue that helps bring the Cardano ecosystem together and maximise collaboration and outcomes within the community.\n\n  \n\n\nTo read the full background, analysis and current documentation for Cardano Contributors please visit - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/cardano-contributors/\n\n  \n\n\nWhy is this category needed?\n\n  \n\n\nThere is a benefit to consider other funding models rather than idea based funding. Strong ecosystems are built on good ideas that are well executed. However the ecosystem also relies on impactful community contributors. The future of funding through Catalyst benefits from both funding ideas and full time contributors.\n\n  \n\n\nThe analysis behind how this contributor focussed category was created can be found here - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/contributor-analysis/\n\n  \n\n\nWhat roles can I apply for?\n\n  \n\n\n* Roles - Development, Coordination and Analysis\n* Role details - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/cardano-contributors/contributor/roles\n\n  \n\n\nCardano contributors candidate - What should be included in the proposal?\n\n  \n\n\nA guide for Cardano contributor candidate proposals can be found here - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/cardano-contributors/contributor-guides/candidate-assessment-guide\n\n  \n\n\nCardano contributors budget guidelines - What budget should a contributor request?\n\n  \n\n\nBudget range guidance for Cardano contributors were defined using research on the average salaries for different roles. Candidates are not forced to follow the guidance provided. The suggested budget ranges for Cardano contributors can be found here - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/cardano-contributors/category-proposal/fund-9/budget-ranges\n\n  \n\n\nCardano contributors minimum thresholds - Is there a minimum number of contributors for each role?\n\n  \n\n\nMinimum thresholds have been added to make sure the right amount of each skill set is selected in each cohort of contributors. The minimum thresholds for this fund can be found here - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/cardano-contributors/category-proposal/fund-9/minimum-thresholds\n\n  \n\n\nCatalyst contributors minimum thresholds - Is there a minimum number of contributors for each role?\n\n  \n\n\nMinimum thresholds have been added to make sure there is enough skills across the cohort of contributors for where help is needed. The minimum thresholds for this fund can be found here - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/catalyst-contributors/category-proposal/fund-9/minimum-thresholds\n\n  \n\n\nWhat is expected from successful candidates?\n\n  \n\n\n* Support the ecosystem - Contributors should focus on returning the highest value to the ecosystem and look to solve the largest problems the community is facing at the time. Those problem areas could include support for improving or creating tools, coordination, resolving governance issues, improving user experience etc.\n* Support the community - Contributors should understand the ecosystem and be able to help the community where it''s needed. That could be answering questions, pointing people to the right resources or bringing more awareness to different areas of the ecosystem that need support.\n* High collaboration - Contributors have the power to be the glue that brings the community together and identifies overlapping or duplicated efforts. The community benefits by contributors spending time understanding different related projects and bringing those together where it would be a benefit to them and the ecosystem.\n* High participation - To be highly effective contributors will need to understand what is happening across the ecosystem to the best of their ability. Contributors may sensibly focus on one or a few areas within the ecosystem where they ensure they are up to date and are aware of the problems, projects, teams and roadmap.\n* Flexible - Contributors will be most impactful if they are able to be flexible in a fast moving environment and move to where they can have a high impact.\n\n  \n\n\nWhat should contributors report?\n\n  \n\n\n* Progress reports - Contributors will report weekly progress reports on what they have been working on in the community, any blockers they have and anything else they feel is relevant.\n* KPI reports - Contributors would not need to report KPI reports like normal idea focussed proposals do. Instead they would focus on increased regularity of progress reports that keep the community up to date on how they are contributing to the ecosystem.\n\n  \n\n\nWhat sort of candidates are most suitable?\n\n  \n\n\n* Approachable - You understand the community will reach out to you regularly and will need to be friendly and supportive to community members.\n* Outcome focussed - You understand that the problems within any ecosystem are complex and take time to overcome but are able to communicate and collaborate on finding solutions.\n* Open minded - You have insights but are always open to new ideas on how to solve a problem. You look to include all perspectives when solving problems.\n* Pragmatic - You understand solving problems often doesn''t start with the perfect solution. You understand the difference between short and long term thinking and how to prioritise what is most important and achievable.\n\n  \n\n\nWhat candidates may be less suitable?\n\n  \n\n\n* Idea focussed - You have a great idea and want to work on it full time. This candidate is less suitable to become a contributor as contributors should not be tied to a single idea. Instead contributors are a collaborative force that helps pull ideas and teams together. This person can make a proposal for their idea if that''s where they want to focus their time.\n* Wants full autonomy and independence - Candidates will need to regularly communicate and collaborate with many community members, ideas and projects regularly. If a candidate wants full autonomy and independence to solve problems then they are likely better suited to idea focussed proposals rather than becoming a Cardano contributor.\n\n  \n\n\nCommunity advisors - How candidates should be assessed\n\n  \n\n\nCommunity advisors should use the following guide when assessing a Cardano contributor candidate proposal - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/cardano-contributors/contributor-guides/candidate-assessment-guide\n\n  \n\n\nCommunity efforts that will support success\n\n  \n\n\n* Proposal support - Help candidates propose a fair budget and salary expectations for their application. Guide candidates to add more proof of existing contributions or professional background where necessary.\n* Progress report reviews - Check on execution of reported progress by candidates to ensure it meets the standards and expectations of the community. Flag and report candidates where necessary for wider community review.\n\n  \n\n\nFuture improvements for full time contributors\n\n  \n\n\nThere are a number of improvements that can be integrated into the model of full time contributors that help support different areas of the ecosystem. A list of ideas can be found here - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/contributor-analysis/contributor-analysis/contributor-future-improvements", "importance": "Cardano needs full time contributors to help improve the development ecosystem in Cardano and stake pool ecosystem", "goal": "Cardano community members solving important problems are funded so they can continue providing high impact", "metrics": "Tracking success for this category will mean:\n\n  \n\n\n* Number of contributions to support Catalyst - Code commits, events organised, coordination support between teams, documentation improvements etc\n* Community support - Conversations with existing development projects and community members and any contributions that help support them\n\n  \n\n\nTracking success for contributors will include improving the reporting process so it becomes easy for the community to understand what each contributor is working on to support the ecosystem. Progress reporting is a requirement for contributors. The tools that are used to log and present this reporting data will need to evolve over time so that the community can easily track what is happening within the contributor community."}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "\u2014- FUNDING CATEGORIES BACKGROUND \u2014-\n\n  \n\n\nFunding categories offer an effective approach for doing funding categorisation in the Catalyst funding process. Funding categories if fully adopted can remove the issues and inefficiencies surrounding challenge settings.\n\n  \n\n\nFunding categorisation has a number of properties that can be analysed. Categorisation can be broad or specific, inclusive or exclusive and recurring or changing. Funding categories have been created based off the properties which are more effective for funding categorisation. Funding categories focus on being broad, inclusive and recurring - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis/categorisation-properties\n\n  \n\n\nUsing more effective categorisation properties results in a number of advantages. Funding categories offer a more efficient, simple, flexible, scalable and egalitarian approach to do funding categorisation than challenge settings. Funding categories are effective for directing funding and also help to increase healthy competition - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis/funding-categories-advantages/overview\n\n  \n\n\nFunding categories achieve similar or often better outcomes than challenge settings for ensuring each focus area has access to funding in a given funding round - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis/historical-analysis-and-comparisons/funding-access-for-each-focus-area\n\n  \n\n\nFunding categories provide a 80% total cost reduction when used as a replacement to challenge settings. The numbers used for this estimation are also conservative - the savings are likely higher!

A weighted average percentage is then achieved from the voting results. This percentage is then converted into the equivalent ADA value that will be requested for that funding category from the total amount of funding that will be available in the next round.\n\n  \n\n\nTo register and participate in the budget weighting vote you can find all of the details in this funding categories documentation - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/catalyst-funding-categories/budget-weighting-votes/fund-9\n\n  \n\n\n\u2014-\n\n  \n\n\nOverview\n\n  \n\n\nCatalyst Contributors is a group of community members voted on by the community to help support and drive the ecosystem forward full time. Contributor roles can include developers, coordinators, analysts, designers and more or a mixture of different expertise. The contributors can be seen as a glue that helps bring the Catalyst ecosystem together and maximise collaboration and impactful outcomes within the community.\n\n  \n\n\nTo read the full background, analysis and current documentation for Catalyst Contributors please visit - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/catalyst-contributors/\n\n  \n\n\nWhy is this category needed?\n\n  \n\n\nThere is a benefit to consider other funding models rather than idea based funding. Strong ecosystems are built on good ideas that are well executed. However the ecosystem also relies on impactful community contributors. The future of funding through Catalyst benefits from both funding ideas and full time contributors.\n\n  \n\n\nThe analysis behind how this contributor focussed category was created can be found here - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/contributor-analysis/\n\n  \n\n\nWhat roles can I apply for?\n\n  \n\n\n* Roles - Development, Coordination, Analysis, QA & Auditing, Marketing, Product and Design\n* Role details - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/catalyst-contributors/contributor/roles\n\n  \n\n\nCatalyst contributors candidate - What should be included in the proposal?\n\n  \n\n\nA guide for Catalyst contributor candidate proposals can be found here - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/catalyst-contributors/contributor-guides/candidate-proposal-guide\n\n  \n\n\nCatalyst contributors budget guidelines - What budget should a contributor request?\n\n  \n\n\nBudget range guidance for Catalyst contributors were defined using research on the average salaries for different roles. Candidates are not forced to follow the guidance provided. The suggested budget ranges for Catalyst contributors can be found here - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/catalyst-contributors/category-proposal/fund-9/budget-ranges\n\n  \n\n\nCatalyst contributors minimum thresholds - Is there a minimum number of contributors for each role?\n\n  \n\n\nMinimum thresholds have been added to make sure the right amount of each skill set is selected in each cohort of contributors. The minimum thresholds for this fund can be found here - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/catalyst-contributors/category-proposal/fund-9/minimum-thresholds\n\n  \n\n\nWhat is expected from successful candidates?\n\n  \n\n\n* Support the ecosystem - Contributors should focus on returning the highest value to the ecosystem and look to solve the largest problems the community is facing at the time. Those problem areas could include support for improving or creating tools, coordination, resolving governance issues, improving user experience etc.\n* Support the community - Contributors should understand the ecosystem and be able to help the community where it''s needed. That could be answering questions, pointing people to the right resources or bringing more awareness to different areas of the ecosystem that need support.\n* High collaboration - Contributors have the power to be the glue that brings the community together and identifies overlapping or duplicated efforts. The community benefits by contributors spending time understanding different related projects and bringing those together where it would be a benefit to them and the ecosystem.\n* High participation - To be highly effective contributors will need to understand what is happening across the ecosystem to the best of their ability. Contributors may sensibly focus on one or a few areas within the ecosystem where they ensure they are up to date and are aware of the problems, projects, teams and roadmap.\n* Flexible - Contributors will be most impactful if they are able to be flexible in a fast moving environment and move to where they will have the most impact.\n\n  \n\n\nWhat should contributors report?\n\n  \n\n\n* Progress reports - Contributors will report weekly progress reports on what they have been working on in the community, any blockers they have and anything else they feel is relevant.\n* KPI reports - Contributors would not need to report KPI reports like normal idea focussed proposals do. Instead they would focus on increased regularity of progress reports that keep the community up to date on how they are contributing to the ecosystem.\n\n  \n\n\nWhat sort of candidates are most suitable?\n\n  \n\n\n* Approachable - You understand the community will reach out to you regularly and will need to be friendly and supportive to community members.\n* Outcome focussed - You understand that the problems within any ecosystem are complex and take time to overcome but are able to communicate and collaborate on finding solutions.\n* Open minded - You have insights but are always open to new ideas on how to solve a problem. You look to include all perspectives when solving problems.\n* Pragmatic - You understand solving problems often doesn''t start with the perfect solution. You understand the difference between short and long term thinking and how to prioritise what is most important and achievable.\n\n  \n\n\nWhat candidates may be less suitable?\n\n  \n\n\n* Idea focussed - You have a great idea and want to work on it full time. This candidate is less suitable to become a contributor as contributors should not be tied to a single idea. Instead contributors are a collaborative force that helps pull ideas and teams together. This person can make a proposal for their idea if that''s where they want to focus their time.\n* Wants full autonomy and independence - Candidates will need to regularly communicate and collaborate with many community members, ideas and projects regularly. If a candidate wants full autonomy and independence to solve problems then they are likely better suited to idea focussed proposals rather than becoming a Catalyst contributor.\n\n  \n\n\nCommunity advisors - How candidates should be assessed\n\n  \n\n\nCommunity advisors should use the following guide when assessing a Catalyst contributor candidate proposal - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/catalyst-contributors/contributor-guides/candidate-assessment-guide\n\n  \n\n\nCommunity efforts that will support success\n\n  \n\n\n* Proposal support - Help candidates propose a fair budget and salary expectations for their application. Guide candidates to add more proof of existing contributions or professional background where necessary.\n* Progress report reviews - Check on execution of reported progress by candidates to ensure it meets the standards and expectations of the community. Flag and report candidates where necessary for wider community review.\n\n  \n\n\nFuture improvements for full time contributors\n\n  \n\n\nThere are a number of improvements that can be integrated into the model of full time contributors that help support different areas of the ecosystem. A list of ideas can be found here - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/contributor-analysis/contributor-analysis/contributor-future-improvements", "importance": "Catalyst needs more community members working full time in the ecosystem so it can reach its potential", "goal": "Catalyst community members solving important problems are funded so they can continue providing high impact", "metrics": "Tracking success for this category will mean:\n\n  \n\n\n* Number of contributions to support Catalyst - Code commits, events organised, coordination support between teams, documentation improvements etc\n* Community support - Conversations with existing projects and community members and any contributions that help support them\n\n  \n\n\nTracking success for contributors will include improving the reporting process so it becomes easy for the community to understand what each contributor is working on to support the ecosystem. Progress reporting is a requirement for contributors. The tools that are used to log and present this reporting data will need to evolve over time so that the community can easily track what is happening within the contributor community."}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "Challenge Updates\n\n  \n\n\n* Top 3 Challenge Category in Fund 8 (see attached).\n* 4x Funded Challenge Setting Proposal (Fund 5, 6, 7 and 8)\n\n  \n\n\nA selection of past-funded ''Scale-Up Hubs'':\n\n  \n\n\n* Vietnamese Hub\n* Cardano Builders'' Hub India\n* Cardano Blockchain Lab in Kenya\n* Homeless Hubs\n* Cardano in South L.A.\n* Cardano in Buenos Aires\n\n  \n\n\nWhat this means:\n\n  \n\n\n1. Demand is growing for this category and we are only at the beginning of what is possible with a network of Cardano hubs globally. The network effect will take hold at some point and when it does, we need to be ready with templates, guides and materials on creating and sustaining a new Cardano Community Hub (CCH).\n2. The impact is real and ROI is being met. Real lives are being affected and improved through this category. This creates a win-win, positive feedback loop as more people benefit from the solutions we offer them, there is even more demand for these services worldwide.\n\n  \n\n\nWhile we are Scaling UP community hubs, we need to Scale DOWN individual capital outlay, to ensure that we can spread as far as possible, as quickly as possible, which is why we work from first principles.\n\n  \n\n\n1. Delivering information to people who would not otherwise have the access.\n2. Ensuring resilience and self-reliance within that community.\n\n  \n\n\nWhen we approach hubs from the lens of information-delivery nodes, we can build a hub taxonomy within a need-impact matrix and then find the most capital efficient model for each location.\n\n  \n\n\nIn other words, consider why a hub exists, in the context of it''s location, access to infrastructure and community readiness. Then design a hub according to those factors, with a traditional brick-and-mortar (CTH) being only one out of many potential information-delivery systems within a local community.\n\n  \n\n\nWith this said, a focus more on ''minimum-viable hubs'' (MVHs) is needed. What is the smallest effective unit for a hub, and by identifying this unit, can we begin to scale CCHs more rapidly.\n\n  \n\n\nHow is the Fund 10 challenge different?\n\n  \n\n\nIn addition to the previous round\u2019s challenge goals, this round will introduce the additional components of tooling, measurement and support for hubs.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\n* The question is: How do we ensure that community hubs are optimizing and scaling efficiently?\n* The answer is: By providing documentation around best practices, building tools that support growth and tracking performance across the global hub network.\n\n  \n\n\nIn this way, not only is the network of hubs growing with each challenge, but the introduction of supporting frameworks and tools allows them to scale efficiently.\n\n  \n\n\nSupporting partners:\n\n  \n\n\nFor Cardano to achieve its ambition of being a global financial and social infrastructure that banks the unbanked, solves wicked problems and pushes for \u201ca more connected, transparent and fair configuration for both the flow of ideas and value\u201d, collaborating for the greater good is key, as outlined by SDG 17, \u201cStrengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development.\u201d\n\n  \n\n\nDuring Fund 6, a community challenge category supported such endeavors, entitled \u201cPartnerships for Global Adoption\u201d - https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/campaigns/26114/stage/all/ideas/unspecified\n\n  \n\n\nCardano stands out in the marketplace of ideas, as a \u201cblockchain for good\u201d, enabling, equipping and empowering \u2018blockchangers\u2019 to solve local, and global problems, helping to build a more equitable, prosperous world for all. The time has come for the Cardano community to scale up in connecting grassroots led hubs within a decentralized impact network, to multinational, multilateral institutions, for greater collective intelligence and positive social and environmental impact.\n\n  \n\n\nIn that spirit, supporting partners have rallied, met the call, and are keen to join forces to collaborate with Project Catalyst to scale up our Community Hubs:\n\n  \n\n\n* The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 54 independent and equal countries. It is home to 2.5 billion people, and includes both advanced economies and developing countries. 32 of our members are small states, including many island nations. Member governments have agreed to shared goals like development, democracy and peace. Their values and principles are expressed in the Commonwealth Charter. The Commonwealth''s roots go back to the British Empire. But today any country can join the modern Commonwealth. The last country to join the Commonwealth was Rwanda in 2009. https://thecommonwealth.org/about-us.\n\n  \n\n\n* The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) \u00a0is the most inclusive intergovernmental platform in the Asia-Pacific region. The Commission promotes cooperation among its 53 member States and 9 associate members in pursuit of solutions to sustainable development challenges. ESCAP is one of the five regional commissions of the United Nations. The ESCAP secretariat supports inclusive, resilient and sustainable development in the region by generating action-oriented knowledge, and by providing technical assistance and capacity-building services in support of national development objectives, regional agreements and the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. ESCAP also provides support to partners at the national level. ESCAP\u2019s national offer is rooted in and linked with the implementation of global and regional intergovernmental frameworks, agreements, and other instruments. The outline of the ESCAP\u2019s Offer of Support at the national level is available here. ESCAP pursues this objective by carrying out work, in close cooperation with other United Nations entities and intergovernmental organizations in the region. https://www.unescap.org/our-work\n\n  \n\n\n* Accelerate 2030, initiated by UNDP and Impact Hub, is the world\u2019s largest program supporting entrepreneurs from developing and emerging markets to scale their solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They leverage the strengths and reach of the global Impact Hub network, United Nations organizations, corporates, investors and expert partners to scale entrepreneurial innovations while contributing to a shift towards a more sustainable economy. Operating in hubs across 20+ locations, Accelerate2030 provides one-of-a-kind scaling support to entrepreneurs through National Scale-Ready Programs across Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America, followed by a Global Scaling Program for those with the highest international scaling potential. https://accelerate2030.net/.\n\n  \n\n\n* One Million Mentors (1MM) is a unique, community-based mentoring project with one simple aim: to connect one million young people with one million life-changing opportunities. This is even more important right now given the impact of COVID-19 on young people. We back the talents of young people to improve their career chances, while at the same time strengthening local communities. 1MM was founded on the belief that through personal, one-to-one mentoring, more young people can grow the knowledge, networks, skills and confidence they need to succeed. By giving them online access to a trained mentor every young person in the country can have the chance to reach their potential.

    '{"brief": "\u2014- FUNDING CATEGORIES BACKGROUND \u2014-\n\n  \n\n\nFunding categories offer an effective approach for doing funding categorisation in the Catalyst funding process. Funding categories if fully adopted can remove the issues and inefficiencies surrounding challenge settings.\n\n  \n\n\nFunding categorisation has a number of properties that can be analysed. Categorisation can be broad or specific, inclusive or exclusive and recurring or changing. Funding categories have been created based off the properties which are more effective for funding categorisation. Funding categories focus on being broad, inclusive and recurring - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis/categorisation-properties\n\n  \n\n\nUsing more effective categorisation properties results in a number of advantages. Funding categories offer a more efficient, simple, flexible, scalable and egalitarian approach to do funding categorisation than challenge settings. Funding categories are effective for directing funding and also help to increase healthy competition - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis/funding-categories-advantages/overview\n\n  \n\n\nFunding categories achieve similar or often better outcomes than challenge settings for ensuring each focus area has access to funding in a given funding round - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis/historical-analysis-and-comparisons/funding-access-for-each-focus-area\n\n  \n\n\nFunding categories provide a 80% total cost reduction when used as a replacement to challenge settings. The numbers used for this estimation are also conservative - the savings are likely higher! Read more here - https://docs.catalystcontributoars.org/funding-categorisation-analysis/historical-analysis-and-comparisons/categorisation-overall-cost-comparison\n\n  \n\n\nThe full list of funding categories can be found here - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/catalyst-funding-categories/\n\n  \n\n\n\u2014- BUDGET WEIGHTING VOTE \u2014-\n\n  \n\n\nThe total budget that gets applied to each funding category is determined using a democratic budget weighting vote.\n\n  \n\n\nFunding categories are assigned a percentage by each voting participant in the vote. A weighted average percentage is then achieved from the voting results. This percentage is then converted into the equivalent ADA value that will be requested for that funding category from the total amount of funding that will be available in the next round.\n\n  \n\n\nTo register and participate in the budget weighting vote you can find all of the details in this funding categories documentation - https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/catalyst-funding-categories/budget-weighting-votes/fund-9\n\n  \n\n\n\u2014-\n\n  \n\n\nOverview\n\n  \n\n\nCommunity & Outreach is focused on the following important areas:\n\n  \n\n\n* Bringing the community together to engage with one another over important problems, topics, causes or for any other important conversations.\n* Talking to people and organisations outside the community looking at how together we can collectively solve problems, explore ways to collaborate or consider different opportunities for innovation.\n* Finding people outside the community interested in learning more about the ecosystem or joining a community that they could be passionate about.\n\n \n\nWhy this category is important\n\n  \n\n\nThe community for any decentralized ecosystem is what makes that ecosystem truly valuable.\n\nSupporting initiatives that help bring the community together or better collaborate with people outside the community will increase the rate the community can learn about different people, communities and problems.\n\n  \n\n\nThe better that communities form around common goals and missions the easier it will be to find potential new solutions or collaborations that improve both the ecosystem and wider society.\n\nEffective community initiatives will improve how people joining the ecosystem find the missions and objectives that they are most passionate about along with the causes they truly resonate with.\n\n  \n\n\nTypes of proposals to include\n\n  \n\n\n* Online & in person events - Any Cardano related event that helps bring new or existing community members together around a given topic or cause.\n* Hackathons - Encouraging new projects and teams to form around different development efforts or for potential innovation focus areas.\n* Public outreach - Proposals for any marketing approaches that can help drive further adoption of the ecosystem.\n* Government outreach & engagement - Outreach and meetings with government officials that help to drive awareness and policy improvements.\n* Demos - Demo tutorials, videos and content showcasing Cardano functionality or DApp features that will help newcomers learn about Cardano and the wider ecosystem.\n* Impact or topic based communities - Support for resources, discussion, events or other initiatives led by communities focussed on different topics or high impact areas within the ecosystem. Topic and impact areas could be about legal, finance, gaming, adoption, the environment or anything else that helps bring the community together around different missions or shared values. Communities should be related to the Cardano ecosystem.\n* Interviews & podcasts - Recorded interviews and podcasts with community members and project teams to showcase news and latest developments.\n* Community hubs - Education, awareness and support based community hubs in different countries internationally.\n* Workshops & courses - Educational workshops and courses that help people learn about what can is available in the Cardano ecosystem that they could use or participate in.\n* Nurturing culture - Initiatives that help with establishing and nurturing a collaborative and open culture within Cardano related communities.\n* Proposer outreach - Outreach approaches to help increase the number of quality proposals submitted into each funding round.\n* Translation support - Support for translating core resources both in the ecosystem or for DApp projects that would help to engage more of the international community.\n* Ecosystem education - Guides and resources about the wider Cardano ecosystem, communities and projects that make it easier for people to understand how to participate and use available solutions.\n\n \n\nPotential success metrics for proposal types\n\n  \n\n\nThis list is not exhaustive but does provides some ideas for proposers to consider.\n\n  \n\n\n* Online & in person events - Number of locations covered, number of attendees, open feedback from attendees about the event.\n* Hackathons - Number of projects created, number of novel solutions, number of teams formed, number of projects initiated that continue after the hackathon.\n* Public outreach - Number of advertisement or content views, number of call to action conversions, percentage increase in traffic for targeted ecosystem sites.\n* Government outreach & engagement - Number of outcome goals achieved from collaboration, number of new supporting government body members.\n* Demos - Number of demo views, number of interactions with demoed product, number of users joined.\n* High impact or topic based communities - Number of community members engaged with the community, number of projects or applications that get created or supported by the community, level of engagement from community members.\n* Interviews & podcasts - Number of views and engagement with audience, number of topics covered.\n* Community hubs - Number of community hub attendees, types of content and information covered, open feedback from attendees about the community hub community or support, number of people supported that then participate or contribute to a given cause or area.\n* Workshops & courses - Number of participants, completion percentage, testimonies on quality of workshops or courses\n* Nurturing culture - Number of participants in the initiative, number of views and interaction for digital content, testimonies on quality of the initiative from community feedback.\n* Proposer outreach - Number of proposals created, number of people viewing or learning about the proposal funding process, number of referrals for proposals.\n* Translation support - Number of languages supported, amount of content translated, number of people interacting with translated resources.\n* Ecosystem education - Number of viewers or participants of education resource, testimonies on the quality of the resources made from community feedback.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nConsiderations for proposers\n\n  \n\n\n* Diversity & inclusion - Proposing an event, meet up, hackathon, community hub or public outreach?

Africa is the next crypto frontier- World Economic Forum\n\n  \n\n\nThis needs to be reversed through intentional action. Otherwise smaller and smaller portions of Catalyst funding will continue to be allocated to projects focused on African and other emerging economies due to endemic barriers.\n\n  \n\n\n\"*Having a funding round that focuses on Africa is a win, win, win scenario. Africa wins by getting some backing. Commercial projects that are already building up in Africa win, because they get the signal of support from our community.
