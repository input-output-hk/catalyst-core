# Address

Jormungandr comes with a separate CLI to create and manipulate addresses.

This is useful for creating addresses from their components in the CLI,
for debugging addresses and for testing.

## Display address info

To display an address and verify it is in a valid format you can utilise:

```sh
$ jcli address info ta1svy0mwwm7mdwcuj308aapjw6ra4c3e6cygd0f333nvtjzxg8ahdvxlswdf0
discrimination: testing
public key: ed25519e_pk1pr7mnklkmtk8y5tel0gvnksldwywwkpzrt6vvvvmzus3jpldmtpsx9rnmx
```

or for example:

```sg
$ jcli address \
    info \
    ca1qsy0mwwm7mdwcuj308aapjw6ra4c3e6cygd0f333nvtjzxg8ahdvxz8ah8dldkhvwfghn77se8dp76uguavzyxh5cccek9epryr7mkkr8n7kgx
discrimination: production
public key: ed25519_pk1pr7mnklkmtk8y5tel0gvnksldwywwkpzrt6vvvvmzus3jpldmtpsx9rnmx
group key:  ed25519_pk1pr7mnklkmtk8y5tel0gvnksldwywwkpzrt6vvvvmzus3jpldmtpsx9rnmx
```

## Creating an address

Each command following allows to create addresses for production and testing
chains. For chains, where the discrimination is `testing`, you need to
use the `--testing` flag.

There's 3 types of addresses:

* Single address : A simple spending key. This doesn't have any stake in the system
* Grouped address : A spending key attached to an account key. The stake is automatically
* Account address : An account key. The account is its own stake

### Address for UTxO

You can create a single address (non-staked) using the spending public key for
this address utilising the following command:

```sh
$ jcli address \
    single ed25519e_pk1jnlhwdgzv3c9frknyv7twsv82su26qm30yfpdmvkzyjsdgw80mfqduaean
ca1qw207ae4qfj8q4yw6v3ned6psa2r3tgrw9u3y9hdjcgj2p4pcaldyukyka8
```

To add the staking information and make a group address, simply add the account
public key as a second parameter of the command:

```sh
$ jcli address \
    single \
    ed25519_pk1fxvudq6j7mfxvgk986t5f3f258sdtw89v4n3kr0fm6mpe4apxl4q0vhp3k \
    ed25519_pk1as03wxmy2426ceh8nurplvjmauwpwlcz7ycwj7xtl9gmx9u5gkqscc5ylx
ca1q3yen35r2tmdye3zc5lfw3x992s7p4dcu4jkwxcda80tv8xh5ym74mqlzudkg42443nw08cxr7e9hmcuzals9ufsa9uvh723kvteg3vpvrcxcq
```

### Address for Account

To create an account address you need the account public key and run:

```sh
$ jcli address \
    account ed25519_pk1c4yq3hflulynn8fef0hdq92579n3c49qxljasrl9dnuvcksk84gs9sqvc2
ca1qhz5szxa8lnujwva8997a5q42nckw8z55qm7tkq0u4k03nz6zc74ze780qe
```

### changing the address prefix

You can decide to change the address prefix, allowing you to provide more
enriched data to the user. However, this prefix is not forwarded to the node,
it is only for UI/UX.

```sh
$ jcli address \
    account \
    --prefix=address_ \
    ed25519_pk1yx6q8rsndawfx8hjzwntfs2h2c37v5g6edv67hmcxvrmxfjdz9wqeejchg
address_1q5smgquwzdh4eyc77gf6ddxp2atz8ej3rt94nt6l0qes0vexf5g4cw68kdx
```
