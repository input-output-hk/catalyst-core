    '{"brief": "It is indeed a challenge to any community to redefine the very concept of itself in the apparent absence of applicable, historical precedent. Without a relatable narrative, even the most imaginative minds can be forgiven for falling back on legacy concepts and inherited structures, all while seeking to break the mold and redefine it. And according to what model?\n\nWhat does it even look like, to live in a truly decentralized, self-governing community, when all we''ve ever known is an essentially top-down, command-and-control infrastructure?\n\nSure, there''s 32 flavors to choose from at Baskin-Robbins, but one''s choices narrow significantly from there, the more important they become. A truly trustless technology carries the promise of liberating humanity, however, and so this implies the ++unraveling++ of existing modalities of governance, far more so than the creation of new ones.\n\nIf the goal is the strengthening of self-governance, and the shaping of legislation and commercial standards accordingly, I posit the best approach to be a practical one, in keeping with the true bottom-up nature of decentralization. As for historical precedent, who would''ve guessed the answer to that age old question, *\"But without government, who will build the roads?\"*, can be found in a piece of near-forgotten history from over 180 years ago?\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville was an aristocrat and political scientist from the Courts of Versailles, France, who eventually became Minister of Foreign Affairs, and he is universally acknowledged as the father of sociology and social anthropology throughout most all of western academia. As with many others in Europe at the time, de Tocqueville was mesmerized with this strange new nation called America across the sea.\n\nIn 1831 he finally visited and chronicled his travels within his famous, ''Democracy in America'', published in 1835; the second volume published another 5 years thereafter. In it, de Tocqueville described the astonishment with which he found a near total absence of government in nearly every township he paid visit to, save for the local post office. This was unfathomable to him, for in his native France there were government offices everywhere, with breadlines feeding the poor and destitute, stretching for blocks\u2026 By contrast, in America, what little he could find of the poor and needy were all dutifully cared for by an abundance of charitable organizations; the people keeping 100% of their earnings while looking after their own communities themselves. The discrepancy in literacy rates also astounded him, with barely 10% who could read in his native France, compared with the over 90% literacy rate he found in the States.\n\nPeople maintain that charities could never sustain the needs of the poor today, but if you try to feed the homeless in most cities you will be arrested!\n\nA better way of phrasing the aforementioned question of *\"Who will build the roads?\"* isn''t by hearkening to any notion of zero government, so much as highlighting its replacement with self-government instead. Roads and public services were of course funded directly by community-minded citizens in the old Town Hall meetings of New Hampshire, for example, without any of the trustless automation that can now be leveraged. Centralized, top-down administration of these services have become so intertwined with our very concepts of how communities must operate, it''s not surprising it was a source of bewilderment to Monsieur de Tocqueville just as it is now for us today, and so many years later\u2026\n\nWhat''s perhaps more surprising is why you''ve probably never even heard of de Tocqueville until now. Given these historically remarkable findings from early American society, and his being recognized as creating the science of anthropology itself. Yet even if one studied the subject now, it would probably surprise one even more to discover his near-complete absence from the books currently in print\u2026\n\nAs former Secretary of Education under Reagan, Gary Bauer, openly declared: for every $1 collected in tax for the purpose of education, only $0.25 ever goes to the actual schools to pay for the teacher''s salaries and books. A full 75% of it simply lines the walls of the ever expanding bureaucracy there in D.C., like some malignant tumor! I was so stunned by this announcement when I finally heard it (many years later), I personally contacted his offices to confirm it, and he told me now it wasn''t even $0.20 out of every dollar\u2026\n\nI then researched the average expenditure in taxes per pupil in D.C. for that year, and it was over $26,000 per head - more than a year''s tuition at Montessori! But private schools are just as dependent upon government licenses to teach as those that are declared public, and the books, now bereft of any hint as to how communities can indeed thrive much better under the liberty of self-governance, reflect the purposeful neglect a top-down mode of governance imposes for its own sake just the same. But as far as public services are concerned, I know education is still perhaps a bit too delicate a subject for most to accept the decentralization of. Best keep it to street cleaning and such for starters!\n\nThe concept of a decentralized, self-governing community is so foreign, most people assume there''s no historical context by which it may be easily conceptualized. The fact de Tocqueville is acknowledged as the father of socio-anthropology, and yet had his own observations removed from all the books on the subject, says something as to why\u2026 but what he recorded is proof this has been achieved before, and was so powerfully successful compared to the top-down models of governance, its example had to be censored.\n\n*\"A Republic, if you can keep it.\"* ~ Benjamin Franklin\n\nCardano very much represents an opportunity for, not just a return to sound money, but a return to a truly decentralized community of self-governance, such as the Republic to which Franklin referred.\n\nAlso Ben: *\"When the people find that they can vote themselves money that will herald the end of the Republic.\"*  \n\nThis is unfortunately beginning to happen now, and it''s easy to understand why. When the ability to earn oneself a living is removed, of course people will vote themselves money ad infinitum, but this must be acknowledged as an extremely urgent and dangerous situation! Especially when the concept of decentralization, while generally positive, still resides somewhere in the \"nice to have\" category of perspective; much like the other benefits of blockchain, such as immutability, security, inclusiveness, etc. People are still looking at decentralization and thinking, yes that''d be \"nice to have\"\u2026\n\nWell let''s take a look at what we *do* have at the moment:\n\n\\- Central Credit Monopoly  \n\\- Media Mind Control  \n\\- Destruction of Private Industry\n\nEssentially, Planks 5, 6, & 7\u2026\n\nDecentralization *is not* a \"nice to have\", it is a **must**.\n\nAs mentioned in the metrics section, this challenge is for proposers from all nations, and a truly decentralized, self-governing society is the goal. America is where we may find the greatest, socio-anthropologically confirmed, recorded example of decentralization''s outstanding success. By contrast, another example of what''s being hailed as a \"self-governing\" success, are the new, private company governed townships being offered in Nevada, where technocratic Lord-Barons pose to make a dubious return (see https://reason.com/2021/02/08/tech-companies-could-form-their-own-governments-under-a-new-nevada-proposal/).  \n\nPower always seeks to maintain its perch, and expand it where ever it may. The technology available to us now will be wrestled over to this end, and this may be our last chance to show the world how much better a truly self-governing society can and would be, should that power be finally pushed to the edges.\n\nThank you for your consideration and your time!\n\n*\"A man''s admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him.\"* ~ *Alexis de Tocqueville*\n\nhttps://sleepingnatives.org/projects.html#alexis", "importance": "*Community mindedness* today risks veering from its original meaning. Self-governance is, by definition, a bottom-up, not top-down, approach.", "goal": "Elected authorities from amenable jurisdictions become local heroes for greatly reduced taxes. Private companies are paid more and on time.", "metrics": "\\* Please note: this challenge is open to proposers from all continents and nations.\n\nProposers are welcome to explore and weigh the merits of transaction metadata, smart contracts, tokens, smart markets, and/or any combination thereof in the determination of how best to align services with specific zones & localities (such as street cleaners and/or garbage collectors, for example), contracted for a given term.\n\nCollaboration will prove a key factor here. A project of this scope will require talent and expertise across a wide array of skillsets and disciplines. Prospective proposers are encouraged to engage (across the project''s Discord channel or elsewhere) in order to build a team that can arguably, if successful, help change the tide of history (more on that below)!\n\nOf greatest initial importance will be the opt-in, by at least one local government authority and a service provider, to accommodate a Proof Of Concept within a pilot jurisdiction. The boon from a successful POC, for any politician (as a now-lauded and pioneering visionary), will yield them a near certain re-election and serve as a model for blockchain efficiency, with subsequent demands for its expansion and implementation elsewhere.  \nKey metrics:\n\n*   The proposed solution must demonstrate a substantial savings to be had by the taxpayer, as compared to the amount local governments set aside for the contracted service from a given tax (like property taxes). Each local government participant is expected to act as an honest broker in these arrangements, redacting 100% of the respective service(s) being off-loaded; the key word being \"expected\". This comparison should be made between the projected operating costs of the proposed solution, once deployed, versus the status quo. Initial development costs will no doubt skew this comparison in the beginning, so it''s important to keep in mind the savings from an ongoing perspective, especially when instantiated across multiple jurisdictions.\n*   Initially, service providers themselves should expect remuneration to not only be significantly greater than when contracted by their local authorities, but also to be paid far sooner than is typically the case for any government contractor.\n*   As time progresses, new businesses wishing to compete within the service provider''s space should also be accommodated for proposals to the local community from within the deployed solution, so that citizens may collectively choose for themselves which provider the service will be granted, and for how long (with a likely quorum being required for the contracting of a given area or district); much like a digital \"Town Hall\" for each local community, for citizens to decide on local matters.\n*   As with any advancement in automation and technology, government jobs can also be expected to be made redundant/nonessential. While this isn''t necessarily the kind of key metric they themselves might look forward to, private markets have born the brunt of such consequences of innovation to a disproportionately larger degree, and for far too long. If there''s any sector in need of economizing and reducing waste, for sure it''s within the government. What''s good for the goose is surely good for the gander!\n*   Last but not least, while politicians themselves may regret the latter, they can most assuredly expect a much happier electorate as a result, redounding to a re-election. It really depends if they are for big government, or small."}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "A for ADA\n\nB for Bitcoin\n\nThe community-driven effort of creating the crypto-alphabet for the children. The community will vote and express an opinion, volunteer to create rhymes for particular letters and drawings.\n\nWe all agree is that A is for Ada, B for Bitcoin, But D might be for Dash or Decred?\n\nH might be for Horizen or Holochain\n\nT for Tezos or Telos\n\nWhat letter to choose? Let the community decide.\n\nEither by voting or \"supporting\" a particular letter, the community can decide. I.e. if some of you want Horizen to \"win\" the letter H - then you can send any amount of ADA to the project''s address. Then if suddenly Hedera Hashgraph fan appears and start competing with you - the competition to the letter might continue for hundreds or thousands of ADA.\n\nThis crypto-alphabet will be published as Book and distributed for all of the community - first of all, those who take an active part in Project Catalyst. Then as presents to different Cardano meetup attendees, future conferences, and summits, but also it will be sold both as digital and as a paperback. As this project is applying for treasure funds, so the potential profits will be used to rewards active participants of the book creation, additional creation of book supplies, and maybe reserve fund for future activities. I know a publisher who agreed to do this project in my country, and have also their distribution network - so also the book will be sold for people outside of crypto area, which is good as it brings additional brand awareness and potential adoption.\n\n  \n\nThere are 2 option for illustrations:\n\n1\\. Children will draw the illustrations, first of all children of people from Cardano ecosystem, but it can go further to other communities\n\n2\\. We''ll find a designer (it''s not a problem, when the text is ready, each letter - represents each crypto, so it won''t be hard for designer to draw illustration based on it). Maybe the designer from community will be willing to join this project.\n\n  \n\nI''m putting the budget of $4800 USD which will be enough to print 2000 copies of book (well, maybe we should print more) and rewarding all the people who contributed (designers, text creator) and book shipping costs\n\nMany aspects of the process are up for the community to decide", "importance": "The earlier to start financial education - the better it will be in the long-term.\n\nCryptoalphabet - community-created Alphabet for children", "goal": "As community defines it. I.e.

Same dimensions of land and oceans - but all continents metaphorically merged to one continent called PANGEA. Basic theme is the gamified foundation of stable new settlements on this Earth-like planet. The settlers would still be in well-integrated contact with home-planet Earth, but sufficiently far away to be forced doing independent experimenting.\n\n++**FUND 5 CHALLENGE: Focus on conception, MVP-developments & piloting.**++ This would set the frame for a larger number of proposers and partners, contributing to the necessary developments. As an outcome, we would establish the core teams and would jointly implement and pilot the basic technologies and concepts.\n\n++**Second Phase: Scaling (Fund X and/or based on external co-funding)**++  \nOnce proven in careful piloting, we would start the scaling phase. This is all about signing up ''players'' and metaphorically establishing and registering the highly decentralized habitats on PANGEA. The first focus would be put on (playfully) securing basic survival with setting up energy, water, hygienic, food-supply and basic agricultural production, IT infrastructure and controlling of other vital parameters (in reality: starting to apply our concepts by making our real earthly homes as decentralized as possible, including utilities supply, growing some food, establish excellent IT infrastructure etc. - a source of a careful and never-ending merchandizing income stream).\n\n++**Next phase: Establishing and growing the virtual PANGEA society**++  \nThen, the challenge would continue with grass-root-refinement of a new form of highly decentralized PANGEAN society composed of independent individuals in small ''settlements'' (should of course be a playful metaphor for our own homes and apartments). Following the growing number of settlers and settlements, the story-plot would lead to establishing the more and more complex governance structures and the PANGEA constitution based on the initial constitution draft and the CARDANO technology framework to support this process. After this, the game would move on and on, adding many new participants. Initially we would still follow our story-plot. Then, step-by-step, the framework could enable regional and individual sub-plots and potentially open a self-governed and non-plotted future.\n\n**++Conclusions++:** **Key of all this is to rapidly scale-up Cardano among a very new user-group. We can learn the ABC of decentralized and algorithms-supported governance. This way we contribute to building a better world by gaining real practical experience based on fun, openness and compassion.**", "importance": "Cardano offers cool technologies for building a better world.

    '{"brief": "The premise of this challenge is based on the idea that the Cardano Community must move forward (in a structured way) towards increasing self-governance. This process should be inclusive of both ''The Big 3'' (Cardano Foundation, Emurgo and Input Output Global) and the community at large. We should celebrate both submissions and involvement from these organisations.\n\nI am suggesting this will be the first of 3 rounds of challenges:  \n\n1.  **Governance Symposium** to canvas for ideas and building blocks.\n2.  **Constitutional Convention**. Once we have seen the research and ideas from the community and professionals we would invite submissions which propose a ''complete solution'' that puts these building blocks together for the community to vote on. There would be little funding (maybe none?) for this challenge, but submitters would be invited to propose projected implementation costs and stages. We would have a single ''winner'' from the community vote.\n3.  **Implementation**. The exact details of this would flow from the outcome of round 2, but with the community now understanding the desired ''end goal'' we can break out the different pieces needed to move forward and invite multiple parties to propose how they would build/implement the specifics.\n\nThe exact nature of the proposed 3 rounds might change as the community responds, but awareness of this should help frame the mindset for responders to this (the first) round. Having said that... these building blocks will still be independently useful to the community''s self-governance journey, even if we change our approach in a more fundamental way.", "importance": "Many layers to this problem, including election practices and structures; funding models; legal entities and agency; implementation bodies.", "goal": "Proposers would submit things like research papers; positions of legal advice; or open source code to contribute to ongoing dialogue.", "metrics": "Submissions should be concrete and detailed, certainly more than just simple advice or ideas.  \nSome ideas on the sorts of submissions that would help the community move forward:\n\n*   An open source library of code that can add one or more capabilities to an on-chain DAO, such as elected positions, multi-sig voting, periodic funding release.\n*   Protocol level research into how Treasury funding should be released through wallets that have key holders.\n*   Academic research into different governance systems that people can be elected into along with various pros/cons on what sort of ''balance of power'' mechanisms they create.\n*   Lawyers from specific jurisdictions (Wyoming? Switzerland?) that would venture some legal opinions on how to structure a not-for-profit foundation with a constitution/charter that requires them to ensure the existence, integrity and election of a DAO that could function as its ''Board of Directors''\u2026 or other such scenarios that integrate on-chain models with the real world legal systems.\n*   Research into how open source foundations (particularly anything blockchain related) protect themselves whilst still moving forward into the future\u2026 e.g. copyright, trademarks, law suits, funding models.  \n    There will be many more avenues of interest to pursue\u2026 these are just to give people ideas about the types of ''deliverables'' we might expect to see.\n\nFor Community Advisors, I am proposing the following scoring categories for this challenge:\n\n*   **Impact.** The proposal should be tightly focused on governance problems that are of relevance for the Cardano community and/or the Catalyst project. Avoid proposals that are overly vague or try to solve only ''real world'' election problems without grounding them in a Cardano context.\n*   **Reusability**. The proposal should not be putting forward a solution that cannot be picked up by other teams in later rounds as part of a larger governance framework. e.g. Technical proposals that are not open source, or too specific (like focusing on running a small club).\n*   **Auditability**. The proposer has provided some verifiable details on why they are a good person to undertake this work, along with some mechanisms for the Voting Committee to perhaps release funding in a staged way. e.g. an academic paper might consider exposing a rough outline and/or early drafts at a set of date milestones to the Voting Committee."}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "In the past decade, we have seen that the opinion of a collective group of people can be manipulated, literally steered, toward the desired conclusion of some entity through social engineering. The main driver of this is the sharing of misinformation on social media. Social media platforms profit by keeping eyes on screens, which incentivizes the platform to validate a user''s confirmation bias as they are shown information they WANT to believe, but may not necessarily be true.\n\n  \nThe objective of this challenge is NOT to come up with a solution for the sharing of misinformation on social media or to create a new decentralized social media platform. That is a big problem with big questions and seems to be outside the current scope of Project Catalyst. Instead, it is more prudent to focus on practical solutions that can be implemented in the short-term and can have an immediate impact on the community.\n\n  \nIn this spirit, perhaps efforts towards helping individuals recognize misinformation, or giving them methods to validate information in a decentralized and trusted way is more worth our time and money. The Cardano subreddit is one of the most active cryptocurrency forums as measured by both comments and posts per user per day\\[1\\] . This recent influx of new users asking questions about the Cardano protocol and participating in the discussion on social media channels demonstrates that solutions for conveying trustworthy information for all levels of education is in high demand. It is important that methods of preventing social engineering be developed now, while the Cardano protocol is still young and in its formative years.\n\n  \n\"*Elevator Pitch*\"  \n**Therefore, the objective of this proposal IS to focus on the development of a trustful method to help community members of all levels of education find, share, and verify information about Cardano that each individual can know is true. The result of this future Fund5 challenge will bring about solutions to battle misinformation designed to harm the network through education.**\n\nMajor decisions about Cardano will be made by the community via its voting mechanisms. Cardano is a social experiment just as much as it is a technical one, which is why it''s imperative to have mechanisms in place to help people make the best decisions possible for the health and future of the network. It will be easy to make \"naive\" conclusions about what may benefit the long-term health and growth of the network because:\n\n  \n\n  \n1) voters may not be familiar with the game-theory that was initially used to develop the incentive mechanisms that were designed to facilitate trends that would lead towards long-term health of the network. In turn, voters may make decisions naively, thinking a voting proposal is in the interest of the network but, in fact, is not.  \n2) voters tend to make decisions myopically by focusing on short-term, personal gain as opposed to long-term network benefits.\n\n  \n\n  \n\nA social engineering attack designed to leverage these two scenarios could be the first phase, an opening of the door, to a greater attack designed to damage the network or its long-term health. So, it seems reasonable that there should be a check on these two scenarios to proactively defend against threats. The systems being developed to address the two above issues, along with their drawbacks are discussed below.\n\n  \n\n  \nIssue 1:  \nVoters may not be familiar with the game-theory that was initially used to develop incentive mechanisms that were designed to facilitate trends that would lead towards long-term health of the network. In turn, voters may make decisions naively, thinking a voting proposal is in the interest of the network but, in fact, is not.  \n  \n\nProposed Solution:  \n\\- A \"Liquid Democracy\" system that will allow voters to delegate their vote to an \"Expert\" in a manner they see fit when they feel they are not in a place to make a wise decision  \n  \n\nPotential Drawbacks:  \nCurrently, for the greater population of voters, the primary source of information to make a voting decision is whatever is provided by the Catalyst Voting mobile app. The information provided in the app by each proposer goes through multiple rounds of revision by community advisors, which provides rigor. As great as that process is, there will ultimately be proposals on decisions that will require knowledge that is outside the scope of an average individual''s knowledge or abilities. The \"Liquid Democracy\" model will allow a voter to delegate their vote in this scenario.\n\n  \nHowever, the problem still stands; If an individual does independently decide that their vote needs to be delegated, an informed and educated decision still needs to be made. Whom is the individual to trust when making the decision to delegate their vote? Can the expert be trusted? The expert has an incentive to gather voting power and may say whatever is necessary to get it. The expert could put false information out there, or partner with an entity that will propagate false information in the interest of the \"expert\". The expert''s motivation could be to intentionally do harm to the network or, even worse, may think their intentions are good, but have, in-fact, succumbed to misinformation.  \n  \n\n  \n\nIssue 2:  \nvoters tend to make decisions myopically by focusing on short-term, personal benefits as opposed to long-term network benefits  \n  \n\nProposed Solution:  \n\\- Financial incentives to participate in the voting process  \n\nPotential Drawbacks:  \nVoters, as well as Experts, will be financially incentivized to participate in the voting process. Research shows that this will boost turnout \\[2\\]. However, this does not incentivize educated voting decisions. Voters could submit ballots by just checking off one choice, perhaps whatever is listed at the top, putting in the least effort possible to receive a reward. Another scenario; voters could checkoff all choices in the misguided thinking that they will receive more rewards with more ballots cast. Therefore, the financial incentive is not enough of a check to ensure good decision making. Greater checks can be put in place if the incentives for decision making in the short-term align with desired outcomes to protect the long-term health of the network. The preceding examples are of the extreme case; there is perhaps no way to incentivize those individuals to participate in a valuable way. But that is exactly why this challenge is so important.  \n  \n\n  \n\nThis project is feasible because:\n\n*   There are similar constructs out there that already exist for sharing content. Another''s business model could be used as a starting point\n\n  \nThis project is auditable because:  \n\n*   The following requirements can be used to facilitate auditability:  \n    Within 60 days of the close of voting for Fund5, winners of funds will publish a whitepaper outlining and describing:\n*   How the funds will be budgeted\n*   How the below would be achieved and on what timeframes:\n*   Creation of a dApp that:\n*   Serves as a repository and curation platform for content about Cardano. Hosted content should be of multiple modalities (text, video, audio, etc.)\n*   Allows users to verify accuracy of information via links to primary sources\n*   Incentivizes content creators to create or submit content that:\n*   is engaging and factual. It can be verified through primary sources\n*   is diversified so that it meets the needs of a wide range of educational levels, cognitive abilities, and cultures\n*   Incentivizes content consumers to:\n*   verify content\n*   Promotes education as a method to help make an informed decision\n*   Helps promote social incentives for voting in a manner that benefits the ecosystem to help deter the threat of future social engineering intended to harm the network\n\n  \nThis project is impactful because:  \n\n*   There is a high demand for knowledge and education about Cardano and it will only continue to grow. This project proactively reduces the potential that misconceptions and misinformation will propagate\n\n  \n\n  \n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI put this Community Choice Challenge out to the community to try to devise clever ways to possibly create extrinsic motivation for even the most extreme cases. Perhaps the solution creates a social incentive. Maybe a reputation system is developed (similar to stack exchange) to incentivize people to create and communicate accurate, high quality content. As opposed to stack exchange''s votes, maybe real ADA could be spent to validate accurate, high quality content. Real ADA could be earned for the creation of content. These are just suggestions and not part of the requirements for auditability of the challenge. Again, this challenge is not intended to create a decentralized social media platform. Think more towards the direction of Wikipedia, not Twitter. I don''t see my role as coming up with the solution, we should fund this challenge so we can discover what the clever Cardano community can dream up!  \n\n**Sources:**\n\n*   \\[1\\] https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/l73uhn/cardano_doesnt_have_the_largest_community_yet_but/\n*   \\[2\\] https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/04/04/how-do-we-get-people-vote-lets-try-financial-incentives/\n\n**Additional Resources:**  \n\n*   https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/glaeser/files/democracy_final_jeg_1.pdf\n*   https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/cutting-edge-leadership/201712/why-do-people-vote-against-their-best-interests\n*   https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/10/civics-education-helps-form-young-voters-and-activists/572299/", "importance": "Voters do not always vote in their own best interest.

    '{"brief": "Currently the vast majority of DeFi dapps and currency flows occur on the Ethereum blockchain, however due to congestion and increased transaction fees, the use of DeFi is increasingly elitized, leaving out the people who could most benefit from it. benefit from this, the unbanked.\n\n  \nTo make simple swap transactions between 2 tokens a person can spend more than 10 dollars. More complex transactions that require more space in blocks easily pass $ 100. While Ethereum 2.0 is not implemented, different solutions to the problem of congestion and high transactions fees are being developed, some involve the use of a second layer in Ethereum 1.0 (Zk rollups, Optimistic rollups, Plasma, etc.), others involve the creation of DeFi in other blockchains, like Cosmos and Polkadot, but this is not restricted to just these two, many blockchains are focusing on the development of DeFi.  \nThis image represents the ecosystem of DeFi-related projects at Polkadot.  \nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/Erz71y2XAAUO1Ek?format=jpg&name=large\n\n  \nThe current situation shows that there is a huge public that is unable to use DeFi due to high transaction fees and several projects are developing solutions for this. I believe that Cardano is an excellent option for this.  \nBut why Cardano?\n\n  \nThere is a concept that the DeFi community is well aware of, which is the composability of protocols / dapps. This allows several smart contracts of different dapps/protocols to interact with each other, this concept of composability is often referred to \"DeFi legos\", in analogy to the LEGO building toy. In this analogy, each dapp / protocol would be a lego and the combination of these can leverage DeFi, creating more options, services, liquidity, among other positive aspects, but it can also leverage risks from poorly programmed, unaudited contracts, excess leverage and risks in general.  \nImagine that the primordial dapps were at the base of a pyramid and more complex dapps were built above these. These articles are a good source of information on the subject:  \nhttps://medium.com/pov-crypto/ethereum-the-digital-finance-stack-4ba988c6c14b  \nhttps://medium.com/@roypritam1234/decentralized-finance-defi-stack-built-on-ethereum-feea8f93a47d\n\n  \nThe problem is that the money LEGOS composability brings systematic problems and this is exacerbated by the problems caused by the absence of code with formal verification and this makes Cardano an excellent option for critical applications, such as DeFi dApps.\n\n  \nIn addition to the advantage of having a functional language and portability with KEVM and other languages in the future, we still have MARLOWE, which should facilitate onboarding for people without technical programming knowledge and ATALA PRISM, which should help onboard people without identity documents / without credit score.\n\n  \nIf we want a rich and competitive environment for DeFi on Cardano we need to accelerate the development of these dapps and prioritize their development. With this challenge, we can encourage the creation of native DeFi projects on Cardano and promote Cardano as a scalability and security option for DeFi projects that are on Ethereum and are interested in migrating their project to Cardano. We can use the Catalyst referral program to attract more projects / proposals.\n\n  \nI will mention some project niches that I believe are important for creating a promising DeFi environment on Cardano, all the niches mentioned below have projects implemented (mainly on Ethereum blockchain) and can serve as inspiration for proposers who want to submit proposals on Fund5, if this challenge be chosen by the community.\n\n  \nFor more information on DeFi''s niche markets, I recommend accessing.  \nhttps://defiprime.com/\n\n  \n**I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT ALL THE EXAMPLES SHOWN BELOW ARE IDEAS OF WHAT CAN BE CREATED BY PROPOSALS ONLY IN FUND5, IF THIS CHALLENGE IS CHOSEN BY THE CARDANO COMMUNITY.**\n\n*   **ORACLES AND PREDICTION MARKETS** They allow the inclusion of \"real world\" data in the blockchain, for example, prices of digital assets and unique events, such as the result of a game, weather, elections, among others.  \n    https://chain.link/  \n    https://augur.net/  \n    https://tellor.io/  \n    https://omen.eth.link/#/liquidity  \n    https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/oracle-pools-list\n*   **DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGES (DEXs)** Within DEXs, different DEX models can be created, the most common of which are ++Order books DEXs++ and ++AMM DEXs.++\n*   **AMM (Automated Market Maker)** They enable a more efficient model of decentralized exchange, where sellers and buyers are available to execute a trade without the need for a match order. This model uses liquidity pools to create constant liquidity, essential for tokens with little trade volume.  \n    https://uniswap.org/  \n    https://balancer.finance/  \n    https://app.bancor.network/\n*   **ORDER BOOKS -** They present the same concept as traditional exchanges, where buyer and seller need their offers to have a price match for the trade to be executed, however with the use of blockchains this can be done in a decentralized way.  \n    https://loopring.org/\n*   **DEX AGGREGATORS** Allow users to get price arbitration between different DEXs in an automated and intuitive way.  \n    https://1inch.exchange/  \n    https://paraswap.io/\n*   **MONEY MARKETS & LENDING PROTOCOLS** They allow users to make loans without gatekeepers as intermediaries, only through smart contracts and the economic model of a dapp.  \n    https://www.liqwid.finance/  \n    https://compound.finance/  \n    https://aave.com/\n*   **FLASH LOANS** Allow users to use liquidity poools to borrow from a pool without providing collateral, contact to pay for the transaction in the same block + fee (the profit is left to the arbitrator). This allows atomic arbitration between different dapps by anyone who has technical know-how, but does not have the capital to perform the arbitration.  \n    https://aave.com/\n*   **LIQUIDATION POOLS** They allow users to pool their funds in a pool to liquidate users who don''t have enough collateral.  \n    https://atomica.org/\n*   **DERIVATIVES & OPTIONS** In traditional finance, a derivative is a contract that derives its value from the performance of an underlying entity. This underlying entity can be an asset, index, or interest rate, and is often simply called the underlying.\" Derivatives on DeFi allow this to be done transparently and with accountability, solving problems that exist in the current financial market, problems that have caused rehypotecation of papers (IOUs) in cases like Dole Foods. Algorithmic stable coins can also be understood as a product resulting from a dapp of that niche, since they can be seen as dollar derivatives, like Maker DAO stablecoi, DAI an the new model created by EMURGO, AgeUSD.  \n    https://makerdao.com/en/  \n    https://www.synthetix.io/  \n    https://opyn.co/#/\n*   **INSURANCE** It allows users to be able to cover possible failures and losses associated with a DeFi protocol.  \n    https://nexusmutual.io/\n*   **MARKETPLACES FOR DIGITAL ASSETS** Allow users to trade their digital assets in a decentralized way, the focus here are NFTs, as these are not possible to be traded with conventional DEX models.  \n    https://opensea.io/  \n    https://wax.atomichub.io/\n*   **ASSET MANAGEMENT TOOLS** They allow a dapp to manage his digital assets, through a single interface, automation in the execution of smart contracts and to execute contracts of other dapps within a single platform.  \n    https://yearn.finance/  \n    https://zapper.fi  \n    https://www.tokensets.com/  \n    https://mycrypto.com/  \n    https://defisaver.com/  \n    https://gelato.network/\n*   **ANALYTICIS & CONTENT AGGREGATORS** Analytics is the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in DeFi protocols data and the process of applying those patterns towards effective decision making.

    '{"brief": "**Africa is fertile ground for the adoption of Cardano.**  \nHaving a funding round that focuses on Africa is a win, win, win scenario. Africa wins by getting some backing. Commercial projects that are already building up in Africa win, because they get the signal of support from our community. Cardano holders win when there is an encouraging environment for mass adoption anywhere.  \n  \n\nFocussing on Africa is a strategy that has often been promoted and is openly pursued by IOG and Charles Hoskinson  \n  \n\nThe ROI is likely to be high because community sponsored projects are better run in young and developing economies.  \n\n**What this is:**\n\nA call to activate the Cardano community''s ability to recognise, risk and reward this opportunity to make the world a better place.  \n\n**What this is not:**\n\nThis is not a proposal that needs active work by the proposers, it is a vision that needs votes to become an achievement. If it succeeds the beneficiary is the whole Cardano community. It is a call to close our prejudices and open our eyes, hearts and minds to good people who lack the environmental benefits many of us were born with. Giving them an opportunity to show that circumstances are not something they need charity to rise above and succeed. All that is required is the *equal* opportunity to succeed or fail that many of the rest of us enjoy, but with their hinderances and hurdles lessened and their choices remaining in their own hands.  \n\n**Regardless of whether it succeeds or fails:**\n\nI have had my eyes opened and my mind changed about the potential of Africa. From Africa''s bankers in the west, ex-pats with vision and heart, youth with passions, documentaries that challenged my assumptions and Cardano community members with so much to give.  \n  \n\nThank you to all of you who have commented and interacted with me over the last few weeks.  \n  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/UoOc8FnS7qE  \n\n**Impact:** Fund5 will get underway shortly after the Ethiopian government deal is likely to have been announced and will build on its momentum. Along with this major announcement, Africa has more underutilised talent than this proposal can possibly support but it has unlimited potential to uncover them and get them seen around the world. It is the right time for this community challenge to change the world with maximum effect.\n\n**Feasibility:** Africa is poised for technology focussed growth (see video above), has over 600 technology hubs spread across the continent and is home to 4 of the top 20 fastest growing economies in the world.  \n\n**Auditability:** Like all community proposals it relies on the results of the challenge it proposes to truly prove itself, but the metrics it proposes could give an early indication of how successful it is.\n\n**Budget:** Large enough to attract attention and significant proposals, but small enough to allow other community proposals to seek funding", "importance": "Cardano shines when adoption is global. Africa currently has young entrepreneurs, great growth potential and a government contract imminent.", "goal": "Cardano is considered the best public block-chain operating in Africa\n\nCardano projects in Africa are not isolated but networked and growing", "metrics": "Number of purely African participants  \nNumber of Outside African participants with a significant partnership with African residents  \nFeedback on progress from successful proposals regardless of failure or success  \nNovelty and appropriateness of solutions (hard to quantify, easy to see)  \nNumber of African Fund5 proposals that do not *need* further funding to keep operating\n\nROI of Fund5 community challenge - Grow Africa, grow Cardano"}', -- extra
