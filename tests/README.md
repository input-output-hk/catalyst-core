WIP

Integration tests are divided in four crates, and organized in modules.
This is to prevent `rustc` to re-link the library crates with each of the integration tests (one for each *.rs file / test crate under the `tests/` folder).
Performance implication: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5022#issuecomment-364691154
This is also good for execution performance.
Cargo will run all tests from a single binary in parallel, but binaries themselves are run sequentally.

To run all tests in this folder:
`cargo test --test '*'`
To run component tests:
`cargo test --test component`
To run end to end tests:
`cargo test --test end2end`
To run integration tests:
`cargo test --test integration`
To run non functional tests:
`cargo test --test non functional`
