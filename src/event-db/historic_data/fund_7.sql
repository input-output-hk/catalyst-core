After this first challenge was confirmed, many ideas and debates took place and what is more important, the participation and connection of many people from all over the world that agrees on the importance\u00a0this region has to Cardano''s growth.\n\nWe learnt, improved and grew a lot. However, growth is a continuous process and this challenge is to keep us united towards our goal: increase the adoption of Cardano in Latin America while giving equal opportunities and inclusion to its people.\n\nAs part of the impact this Challenge already generated, is the creation of the Catalyst LATAM community where many Latin Americans are now gathering, lowering the language barriers and start co-creating our own future thru collaboration.\n\nLatin America is a fertile region for mass adoption and create value based on Cardano. It has talented and passionate people that with the proper tools and opportunities can create its own paths and ways to succeed; failure is an option but not a surrender. What latinos only need, is someone to hold theirs back. That''s when Cardano Community and Project Catalyst came into action.\n\nThis challenge is to keep Cardano growing in Latin America, to allow more people to join that wonderful community, and to give a second chance to those that tried but their current living and economic conditions constraints their possibilities to flourish.\n\nWe have an existing Challenge Team that is willing to continue the effort to drive this challenge:\n\nRodolfo Miranda (Argentina), Sebastian Pabon (Colombia), Gustavo Pugliese (Brazil) and Alex Pestchanker (Argentina)\n\nAs a quick onboarding to the Challenge and how to create great proposals for it, we recorded the following video out of a Challenge presentation meetup we did for F7.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXt8AS-okqs", "importance": "Mass adoption requires a global view. Initiatives that focus on emerging economies such as Latin America are key to exponential engagement.", "goal": "A wide spectrum of people from Latin America or with connections to Latin America coming together and forming teams to grow our ecosystem.", "metrics": "*   The volume of proposals originated by Latin American people\n*   The quality of those proposals as well as the impact on their local communities\n*   Number of new local Cardano communities created in latinamerican''s countries or cities\n*   New application and use cases created that are intrinsic to the way of life of latin americans"}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "++Challenge Updates++\n\nTop 3 Challenge Category in Fund 7 by number of submissions (see attached).\n\n2x Funded Challenge Setting Proposal (Fund 5 and Fund 6)\n\n++A selection of past-funded ''Scale-Up Hubs'':++\n\n*   Homeless Hubs:\u00a0\n*   https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367891-48088\n*   Cardano in South L.A.:\n*   https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367936-48088\n*   Cardano in Buenos Aires:\u00a0  \n    https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/367293-48088\n*   Salmon Nation Hub:\u00a0  \n    https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368369-48088\n\n++What this means:++\n\n1.  Demand is growing for this category and we are only at the beginning of what is possible with a network of Cardano hubs globally. The network effect will take a hold at some point and when it does, we need to be ready with templates, guides and materials on creating and sustaining a new Cardano Community Hub (CCH).\n2.  The impact is real and ROI is being met. Real lives are being affected and improved through this category. This creates a win-win, positive feedback loop as more people benefit from the solutions we offer them, there is even more demand for these services worldwide.\n\n++How is the Fund 8 challenge different?++\n\nWhile the growing demand is showing us that the need is there, our focus for the next challenge should be on the other side of the coin. Capital supply.\n\nWhile the facts have proven the necessity of a Community Hubs challenge, there are many other equally as important challenges vying for a position in Fund 8, so we must\u00a0act accordingly. We must make budget requests that allow others to also pursue their goals within the ecosystem, both macro, for Catalyst and micro, within the Challenges themselves.\n\nWhile we are Scaling UP community hubs, we need to Scale DOWN individual capital outlay, to ensure that we can spread as far as possible, as quickly as possible, which is why we work from first principles.\n\n1.  Delivering information to people who would not otherwise have the access.\n2.  Ensuring resilience and self-reliance within that community.\n\nWhen we approach hubs from the lens of information-delivery nodes, we can build a hub taxonomy within a need-impact matrix and then find the most capital efficient model for each location.\n\nIn simpler terms, consider why a hub exists, in the context of it''s location, access to infrastructure and community readiness. Then design a hub according to those factors, with a traditional brick-and-mortar (CTH) being only one out of many potential information-delivery systems within a local community.\n\nThis round will focus much more on ''minimum-viable hubs'' (MVHs), what is the smallest *effective* unit for a hub, and by identifying this unit, can we begin to scale CCHs more rapidly.\n\n++Additional Success Metrics:++\n\n*   Is the hub''s Fund 8 proposal in keeping with the MVH principle?\n*   Do they have an understanding of their target audience?\n*   Can they accurately project their reach (physical and online) in the first 3, 6, 12 months?\n*   Can they accurately project the number of onboarded members to the hub in 3, 6, 12 months?\n*   Have they given an indication of a financial sustainability model?\n*   Have they given an indication of budget costs vs ''cost to launch''? (eg. A CTH may only apply for 1/5 of their cost to launch due to the demand pressures of acquiring catalyst funding)\n\n++Ratings by CAs and Voters should favour:++\n\n*   Proposals that have a budget:cost-to-launch ratio between 1-1.5.\n*   Proposals that do not exceed 5% of the total Challenge budget.\n*   Proposals that account for local needs and infrastructure concerns.\n*   Proposals that show creativity and ingenuity around hub design and information delivery.\n*   Proposals that are using local, recyclable materials and have a commitment to sustainability practices.\n\n--------------\n\nLet''s build an ecosystem that is truly global, allowing everyone to participate to the best of their ability, whatever level they are starting from.\n\nWhen you drive adoption at the ground level, you are doing more than just ''building cool products'', you are empowering people to change their lives in ways they could have never imagined by themselves.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/zK5ralU\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/feXUVDF\n\n++Extra reading (where we are going):++\n\n*   Cumbria, UK Business Hub: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sellafield-invests-26m-to-create-cumbria-business-hub\n*   Rwanda Business Hub: https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/norrsken-foundations-hub-opens-in-rwanda-to-house-1000-entrepreneurs-by-next-year\n\n++Past-funded challenges:++\n\n*   Scale-UP Community Hubs (F6):\u00a0\n*   https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Scale-UP-Cardano-s-Community-Hubs/369413-48088\n*   Scale-UP Community Hubs (F5):\u00a0\n*   https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Scale-UP-Cardano-s-Community-Hubs/352534-48088", "importance": "Without users on the ground level, we are building niche products serving mostly technical people with blockchain expertise.", "goal": "Local Community Hubs across the world where the average person can take part in their own language and with their own cultural understanding", "metrics": "*   How many new Hubs were launched in 2022?\n*   How many developers did this community-focused challenge bring into the Cardano ecosystem?\n*   How many new users of Cardano were onboarded?\n*   What was the total reach of the Hub''s initial marketing launch?\n*   How many external organizations did this community-focused challenge bring into the Cardano ecosystem?"}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "One a superficial level Cardano''s economics are deceptively simple. A fixed monetary supply, a stable and declining rewards rate, all economic transactions instantly accessible through blockchain explorers and a set number of updateable and non-updateable protocol parameters that guide the system''s development.\n\nIn real life, Cardano is a fledgling socio-economic ecosystem.\n\nThe number of users is growing exponentially, and the economic interests and trends are becoming multi-layered and more complex by the day. Macro-economic trends and possible outcomes are necessarily obvious at any moment.\n\nThen there are also protocol parameters that are not only technical - but also economic levers that can move the entire Cardano ecosystem.\n\nThe Cardano economic ecosystem does not live in a vacuum. It is part of a globalized society and these links to \"the real world\" are multiplying and becoming more nuanced.\n\nThere is a need for thorough and meticulous work to map the Cardano economic space, its rules, its dangers, threats and opportunities.\n\nDecentralized research into Cardano''s economics will provide much needed complementary and/or alternative points of view and will provide a solid basis for future implementation of Cardano''s decentralized governance.\n\nIn the traditional economy, systems rely on economic forecasts, using them as a guide to plan future operating activities. Better prediction tools and more minds analysing effects of Cardano''s economic state-of-affairs will provide greater stability and certainty to the system.\n\nGuiding questions\n\n\u2022 What are the economic tools and analytical insights that we need to prioritize first?\n\n\u2022 Which openly accessible and open-source instruments can be developed to enable a wide array of players to visualize and analyze effects of possible and likely changes that may emerge from inside or outside the system?\n\n\u2022 Can we analyze these issues from multiple points-of-view, including from the points of view of different stakeholders \u2013 and outside players who are impacted by the Cardano blockchain?\n\n\u2022 What is the scope of the new Cardano-economics (Cardanomics) we need in order to be able to identify existing and future economic trends for Cardano?\n\n\u2022 How can we predict the future monetary and economic effects of changes and status quo in the Cardano blockchain?\n\n\u2022 What are the mid-term and long-term effects of Cardano''s monetary policy as it stands and what are the consequences of monetary policy alternatives?\n\n\u2022 How will all actors, users and stakeholders in the Cardano ecosystem respond to changes in incentives as times goes by? What can we expect to happen and why? How should we start planning to keep incentives balanced and the system operating at optimum performance for all involved?\n\n\u2022 Can publicly accessible models be developed to provide easy yet comprehensive insight into economic effects of planned future developments in the Goguen, Basho, Voltaire eras? Can models factor in global economic trends, global economic forecasts and/or other relevant factors for the economics of this space?\n\nA challenge team for this challenge will be established if the challenge is approved by voters. The team should probably include community representatives with a greater interest and/or knowledge about economic and monetary issues as well as all enthusiasts for exploring this fledgling space of intersection between economics, game theory, blockchain technology, forecasting and related fields.\n\n  \n\n++How Is this challenge aligned with the Fund8 strategic goals?++\n\n1 Prepare a group of people willing and able to make contributions to the ecosystem.\n\nThe challenge calls for a diverse and knowledgeable group of people with specific skills to make contributions to the Cardano ecosystem, especially to its monetary, economic, tool-making, modelling and research facets.\n\n2.\u00a0Turn Cardano into an open source project.\n\nAll of the required outputs and deliverables from proposals that are funded by Project Catalyst should be made publicly available and open-sourced (if tools, platforms, etc.)\u00a0\n\n3\\. Accelerate the growth and evolution of developer & app ecosystem.\n\nProposals will shine a light on the economic advantages of using Cardano blockchain and provide much needed *long-term economic predictability* in a fast moving space.\u00a0*Economic predictability\u00a0lowers risk and facilitates institutional, corporate and retail adoption, which opens new growth opportunities and new evolution pathways for the developer & app ecosystem.*", "importance": "Independent analysis of economic trends, scenarios and incentives will enhance system stability, educate stakeholders and provide new data", "goal": "Full economic effects of current/future Cardano policies and design are clear. Models, studies and simulations are publicly available.", "metrics": "Cardanomics could initially be defined as the study of the scarcity of Cardano''s token and its implications for the use of the Cardano blockchain''s resources, for providing services, for growth of use and general welfare over time, and a great variety of other complex issues relative to Cardano''s intended use as a global financial operating system.\n\nAt the end of this challenge, we will be asking ourselves: Did we manage to make it easier for outsiders and insiders to understand the current state-of-play in Cardano''s macro and micro-economic trends, economic possibilities and economic scenarios that are materializing or possible?\n\nThe challenge welcomes more general or foundational work in the direction of simulations and modeling of economics in this Cardano space.\n\nCardanomics should explore the behaviour and interactions of Cardano''s economic agents and how our economy works. It consists of many players with diverse roles, from the holder to the research labs, from the hard metal stakepool operator to the DEX, from nation states to companies.\n\n\u2022 Effects of Cardano key economic changes, incentives and trends are independently analyzed in full, as well as their consequences for all categories of Cardano stakeholders\n\n\u2022 Complex interactions of key economic interests of all involved stakeholders and their changes are analyzed in detail, as well as their consequences for all categories of Cardano stakeholders\n\n\u2022 Forecasting models specific to Cardano ecosystem are created utilizing an ever-growing array of available data and fact-based predictions of future scenarios are created\n\n\u2022 Interactive simulations or visualizations are created to analyze consequences of possible exterior and interior changes to economic incentives for stakeholders, their interactions and economic consequences\n\n\u2022 Comprehensive guides and recommendations are developed to plan future conversations and decisions on economic incentives of all types, including - but not limited to - protocol parameter changes and analysis of future parameter changes\n\n\u2022 Analysis and research is performed on economic incentives, economic relations and their effects in other blockchain or even non-blockchain systems if these parameters are of relevance for Cardano\n\n\u2022 Other general or foundational work in the direction of simulations and modeling of economics in the Cardano space\n\n\u2022 Forecasting models and designs that can give insight into possible mid-term and long-term evolution, with the models being flexible enough for incorporating new events.\u00a0\n\n\u2022 Comparative economic analysis of significant trends in key blockchain platforms that are seen as competitors to Cardano and modelling of future developments and implications for Cardano\n\n\u2022 Detailed and well-documented research on Cardano resource utilization, impact, electricity consumption trends, cost/benefit analysis compared to other financial systems\n\n\u2022 Economic analysis can also be aimed at economic effects of Cardano parameter changes on stakeholders (including - but not limited to - stakepool operators, developers, major holders, DEXs, centralized exchanges, ADA holders, voters, governance participants, Cardano users, etc.) and their interactions and economic interests, as well as the implications for the sustainability of the system."}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "As well as Africa, I think we should also put significant focus on Cardano within India.\n\nIndia has a\u00a0massive population of 1.4 billion.\n\n55% are under the age of 30yrs (Wikipedia, 2016 est.)\n\nThere are a significant percentage of unbanked/rural people\n\nworldpoverty.io notes 100 million Indians (7%) live in extreme poverty\n\nCertain rural areas are already using Aadhaar Pay to pay for goods using their fingerprint (see www.payaadhar.in))\n\nMore affluent areas are early adopters of new technologies and India has a lot of skilled IT people\n\nJio telecoms (3rd largest in the world) has 405 million mobile subscribers (Wikipedia, 2019). So there is enough infrastructure and consumer devices in place to make this a serious market right away.\n\nHaving an India focused Catalyst challenge/fund would be very useful to gather teams and ideas and get the Cardano ball rolling in India.\n\nI am not Indian and have no connection to India, but I think that Cardano could be useful to help solve issues that they face and also to grow the Cardano eco-system.\n\nOn the surface issues in India might appear similar to Africa or South America, and there will be some overlap, but ideally local people identifying and solving local issues is best.\n\nEmurgo has an office in India, but not sure what they are up to.\n\nIT in India is well established with a large pool of talent and skills available - we need to let them know about Cardano and the Catalyst funding.\n\n  \n\nThis proposal is intended to focus on India within a Fund8 challenge, with that challenge attracting actionable proposals to grow the community of developers and educators.\n\nSome suggestions for that Fund8 challenge are:\n\n Setting up local Cardano hubs for regular catch ups (virtual or real world)\n\n Local-language websites/socials/YT set up to attract developers/entrepreneurs to explain Cardano and Catalyst at a high-level\n\n Fund a dapp and create a how-to video in local-language as a walk through to help educate and reduce perceived complexity\n\n Run a competition/pitch-fest for dapp ideas with the top 10 ideas get funded to make a MVP\n\n Connect with universities and training centers\n\n Connect with new and established Indian YouTube channels to talk Cardano tech, dev ideas, business opportunities etc to create a buzz about Catalyst funding\n\n Regularly promote awareness of Cardano and Catalyst funding to bring people into the space eg a 12 month campaign\n\nThis is like a big heavy wheel that will take a lot of energy to get turning, but once it starts to move it will (hopefully) keep going with less energy needed.\n\n  \n\nHow much ADA/USD should be available for this proposal?\u00a0\n\nI think it will take a few Catalyst rounds to build the Cardano interest in India, so the first round of investment during Fund8 should be $150k. Subsequent funding rounds can be determined at the time and then voted on by the community.", "importance": "1.4B people.\u00a055% under 30y (2016 est)\n\nLocal Cardano developersbusinesses needed to solve local issues.  \n\nSignificant povertyunbanked", "goal": "Success is having multiple submissions for Catalyst Fund8 for India focused projects, with real-world projects getting funded and built.", "metrics": "The overall key metrics would be:\n\n Increased interaction between Catalyst and Indian focused projects\n\n Number of Indian focused Catalyst submissions\n\n Number of Indian focused dapps/services actually built"}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "The success of Bitcoin spawned numerous off-shoot experiments and the arrival of Ethereum increased tribalism. As the number of altcoins grew, unhealthy \"maximalism\" emerged. The future is multi-chain, however, and the cryptoeconomy thrives when interoperability and cross-chain collaboration are cherished and encouraged.\n\nThere are multiple next generation blockchains with cadres of zealous supporters, highly skilled developers and innovative technologies that Cardano and Project Catalyst can learn from. And, vice versa, we can help other networks thrive by offering the good practices developed in Catalyst. IOG has recently formed the UTXO alliance and started collaboration with numerous partners like COTI and SingularityNET. It''s a good start but more is needed to address the lack of communication, coordination and collaboration between blockchain communities. Missing awareness of each other''s doings forces us to duplicate our efforts. When we are separate we are not able to learn from each other''s achievements or failures.\n\nCardano has a strong, open and inclusive community, let''s make this a real super power and let''s be the first ones to forge strong bonds. Let''s create an enriching, open and safe environment, where people from different communities can find common ground and share knowledge, resources, skills, ideas and visions with one another. Let''s go out there, break the silos and build bridges and presence between us.\n\nHere are some examples of potential DLT/Blockchain entities, communities and projects to explore and collaborate with:\n\nCosmos, dubbing itself the Internet of Blockchains, makes it easy for other blockchains to connect to it\u00a0via their Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC). Massive projects like Binance Smart Chain, Terra, Thorchain and Oasis Network are built on the Cosmos SDK.\n\n*   https://tendermint.com/sdk\n*   https://v1.cosmos.network/intro\n*   https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/apps\n\nPolkadot (and its canary network Kusama) is a light-weight and quickly updateable design where the Relay Chain offers shared security and cross-chain communication, allowing the connected Parachains to focus on fast deployment of services. Its unique crowdloan mechanism invites the community of token holders to voice out which projects should be implemented first. The Nominated Proof of Stake network offers advanced governance mechanisms as well.  \nhttps://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-video-tutorials\n\nAcademically impressive and technologically sound Algorand\u00a0has a unique consensus mechanism Pure Proof of Stake and we can learn a lot from their governance model.  \nhttps://www.algorand.com/technology\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBoasting\u00a0a throughput beyond 4,500 tps and near-instant finality, the EVM-compatible\u00a0Avalanche has quickly become the go-to choice for multiple DeFi projects. It has an innovative multi-chain architecture that utilizes both DAG and Blockchain technologies.  \nhttps://www.avax.network/\n\nOther examples could be e.g.\u00a0Fantom (https://fantom.foundation/intro-to-fantom), Solana\u00a0(https://solana.com/ecosystem),\u00a0IOTA\u00a0(https://www.iota.org/),\u00a0Polygon\u00a0(https://polygon.technology/get-started), Nervos (https://www.nervos.org)\u00a0or any community that is ready for multi-chain reality. Or the proposal can come from a project / solution built on any of these.\u00a0\n\n  \n\nProposals you can submit to this challenge\n\nThis is an open-ended challenge that welcomes any proposal geared for cross-chain collaboration, co-innovation and interoperability. These can be any community-led projects, initiatives, solutions, tools or services. It could mean for instance:\n\n*   New technical implementations connecting Cardano to other blockchains and vice versa (SDKs, APIs, bridges etc)\n*   Governance ideas from other chains implemented as part of the Voltaire road map\n*   Already successful projects expanding from other chains to Cardano\n*   Expansion of Cardano-based projects into other chains\n*   Oracles and other tools to interpret and interact with cross-chain data\n*   Catalyst-created solutions adopted by other chains and communities\n*   Common research, education, outreach and innovation projects with other chains and communities (e.g. podcasts, hackathons, webinars, communication hubs, educational resources)\n\nChallenge Team\n\nWe are seasoned Catalyst community members and \"interoperability maximalists\" who don''t believe that any one chain should rule them all.\n\n*   Filip Blagojevi\u0107 is an active Project Catalyst member since Fund 2, Plutus Pioneer, Atala Pioneer and Emurgo Academy trainee.\n*   Tomi Astikainen is a Veteran Community Advisor who has recently written a book for wannabe crypto investors. He is a Senior Ambassador for Acala/Karura and a driver in the Polkadot/Kusama community in Finland.\n*   Felix Weber is an active Project Catalyst member, Cardano Ambassador and initiator/leader of several community led Projects and initiatives.\n\nOur assessment of the maturity of this proposed challenge:\n\nCardano technology stack is finally mature enough to start inviting proposals for cross-chain collaboration and interoperability. Our proposed challenge is intentionally left open ended and it welcomes a multitude of different solutions. Worthwhile ideas submitted in this challenge should help grow and improve the Cardano and Catalyst community in the near term (next 6-9 months).\n\nThis challenge is therefore aligned with the Fund8 strategic goals:\n\n*   It helps prepare people to make contributions to the Cardano and Catalyst ecosystem.\n*   It helps turn Cardano into an open source project recognized also beyond our community.\n*   It accelerates the growth and evolution of our developer & app ecosystem by inviting contributions from the rest of the blockchain space.\n\nThe budget of $400,000 USD is a moderate 2,5% of the total treasury allocation for Fund8. It should be sufficient to kickstart interoperability and cross-chain collaboration initiatives but might not be enough for any large scale infrastructure projects. Therefore, we encourage submission of \"minimum viable\" and \"proof of concept\" proposals that do include long-term vision and roadmap but which are initially scoped quite small.", "importance": "Interoperability of blockchains and multichain awareness guarantees shared success of the cryptoeconomy as a whole.", "goal": "Collaborative value creation between Project Catalyst and other communities.

However, if a project is presented by \"differently abled individuals\", it must be determined what kind of support the proponent needs or already has, the project will have priority and we must all help to generate good communication and special treatment and the community should get activated to provide additional support.\n\nWhat type of projects would be able to apply here? Or is it aimed towards certain groups to apply for this?\n\nIn this new challenge, any person, team, company or institution that wants to contribute to help people with \"differently abled\" or make donations in the form of practical projects to help make the world a better place can submit proposals.\n\nThis project contains the following ONU sustainable development goals: Well-being, Health and Reduction of Inequalities\n\nThe requested budget (400,000 usd) is only 3% of the money available for Fund 8 and will be to finance the proposals that are presented and approved by the community in this future challenge. We consider that the budget requested is low compared to the importance and positive impact that this new challenge can have on the people who need it most thanks to the CARDANO community\n\nPeople who want to contribute and be part of the team proposing this challenge can say so and will be included in the team, they can find me on telegram: @colbia\n\nYou can also include yourself in the telegram group, the group can find it through the following link:\u00a0t.me/specialcardanoanddonations\n\nThis new challenge is presented by a team that participates in Project Catalyst from Fund4 and Fund5 where we presented projects and the team leader was a community advisor at Fund6. The team members are: A Master''s Degree Lawyer, A computer security specialist programmer, A NFT digital artist. And we have been close to patients with psychiatric treatment and schizophrenia", "importance": "Donating is an incredible act and reflects CARDANO''s values and we must think about people who require special treatment", "goal": "donations from the community in the form of practical projects for the underdeveloped world and projects for \"differently abled individuals\"", "metrics": "An evaluation of the participation of the community\u00a0will be made:\n\n1) the number of proposals submitted in this future challenge\n\n2) the number of comments made by the community\n\n3) the number of votes that the proposals of this fund will obtain\n\nAn evaluation will be made of the quality of the proposals:\n\n4) the results of the rating of the community advisers to said proposals\n\n5) the evidences of the collective construction of the proposals\n\n6) there will be an evaluation of the management in the execution of the proposals\n\nAn evaluation of the social impact of the proposals will be made:\n\n7) the cost / benefit ratio of the proposals\n\n8) the positive impact on the target population of the proposals will be measured\n\n9) the positive image of CARDANO and its community in the target populations of the proposals\n\n10)\u00a0the general results of all the approved proposals will be evaluated after their execution\n\nAn evaluation will be made of the use of the budget requested and granted:  \n\n11) Due diligence in verifying budget utilization"}', -- extra

This challenge has everything to do with the core of governance, as it deals exactly with how to make the governance process distributed, so proposals created in this challenge will be experiments and improvements directly linked to evolution in Voltaire.\n\nGuiding questions\n\n*   How do we encourage people to participate in decision making?\n*   How to qualify community builders(CA/vCAs, Mentors and Proposers) to improve decision making?\n*   How do we ensure the group of decision makers is diverse and accessible to newcomers?\n*   How can we ensure that the Catalyst process keeps iterating to improve?\n*   How can we improve or replace the current experience on IdeaScale?\n*   How will we include the community in decision making?\n\nPotential directions\n\n*   Research on new voting models (e.g. quadratic voting)\n\n  \n\n*   Community surveys\n\n  \n\n*   Research and implementation of alternative open source governance models (alternative or complementary to IdeaScale)\n\n  \n\n*   Software/Platforms/Websites that supports decision making or iteration\n\n  \n\n*   Experiments in social, collaboration, or meeting structures that encourage improved decision making\n\n  \n\n*   Training of Community Advisors, Veteran Community Advisors, Mentors and Proposers\n\n  \n\n*   Low effort ways to engage voters in assessing proposals and tapping into existing insights.\n\n  \n\n*   Voting process improvements.\n\nRATIONALE FOR BUDGET DISTRIBUTION\n\nTo encourage greater diversity of funded teams and proposals each team can request up to $60,000 USD (20%) of the total $300,000 USD total budget.\n\nE.g.\n\nTeam A with 2 proposals of $30,000 USD\n\nTeam B with 1 proposal of $60,000 USD\n\nTeam C with 1 proposal of $40,000 USD + 1 proposal of $20,000 USD\n\nIt is important to note that 25% is the maximum amount of aggregated budget that the same team can request in this challenge, but any amount below that can be requested. This means that the challenge will have space for at least 4 proposals from different teams, which guarantees greater chances for teams with less popularity and that may be overshadowed by more popular teams in the community.", "importance": "Highquality and decentralized decisionmaking, will increase treasury ROI and legitimize decentralized governance.", "goal": "The community is consciously improving decision-making processes while growing a group of committed and collaborative leaders.", "metrics": "To assess the ROI of this challenge we will ask ourselves: Did we get better at distributed decision making?\n\n*   Number of open source governance models tools (models parallel to IdeaScale)\n*   Number of participants in new open source governance tools (models parallel to IdeaScale)\n\n*   Community confidence: avg rating or % of Catalyst members who approve of overall results of a funding round.\n*   Community participation: number of Catalyst participants contributing to improving Catalyst decision making systems\n*   Number of unique wallets participating in the voting stage\n*   \u00a0Number of votes cast by unique wallet\n*   \u00a0Number of votes cast per proposal\n*   Number of voting power per proposal\n*   Ratio of (voting power per proposal/cast votes per proposal)\n*   Number of tools created by the community for voters, CAs, vCAs and proposers\n*   Number of community members using alternative tools to those created by IOG\n*   Number of surveys and survey participants\n\n*   Number of surveys related to alternative voting methods\n    \n*   Number of courses and workshops\n    \n*   Number of courses and workshop participants\n    \n*   Number of new CAs, vCAs, voters and proposers onboarded by the proposals created in this challenge.\n    \n*   Proof of iteration: round over round, is there evidence that \"pain points\" are evolving?

    '{"brief": ".\n\nThe League of Extraordinary Contributors\n\nCardano Contributors League is a community voted for group of funded contributors in the Cardano ecosystem that help to support and drive the ecosystem forward. Contributor roles can include developers, coordinators, communicators, analysts, designers and more or a mixture of different expertise. The contributors can be seen as a glue that helps bring the ecosystem together and maximise collaboration and outcomes within the community.\n\n  \n\nWhy is this challenge needed?\n\nThere is a benefit to consider other funding models rather than idea based funding. Strong ecosystems are built on good ideas that are well executed but the ecosystem also relies on impactful community contributors. The future of Catalyst funding could include funding community contributors as well as just ideas.\n\nThe analysis behind how this challenge brief was constructed can be found here and details the tradeoffs of funding types, the decision to use duration and salary caps and how the challenge total requested budget was decided -\u00a0https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/cardano-contributors-league/\n\nThe tasks and types of role that would be useful for contributors to perform\u00a0will soon be added to the documentation for the Cardano Contributors League -\u00a0https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/cardano-contributors-league/\n\n  \n\nContributors league candidate - What should be included in the proposal?\n\n*   Personal information - Basic personal information such as the candidates name and optionally a profile photo\n*   Professional background - Professional background with skills, education and any relevant information\n*   Contributions - Contributions the candidate has made to the ecosystem so far or wider blockchain community\n*   Budget - Candidates should request their salary expectations for a 6 month time frame. Candidates can request a maximum of $50,000. Candidates should take into account what the market salary rates are for the areas of focus they will be fulfilling and their seniority. E.g. There would be market price difference between a senior and junior developer as well as for different roles such as software developer vs a coordinator. Candidates should provide evidence and justification for your budget where necessary. Candidates should list out any existing funding received from Catalyst and consider this to make any reductions to a final budget requested amount where necessary.\n*   Areas of focus - Detail what parts of the Cardano ecosystem they can help with - Development? Coordination? Events? Catalyst? Scaling? Tools?\n*   Approach to prioritisation and feedback - How will you take feedback from the community and prioritise where you are making contributions?\n\n  \n\nWhat is expected from successful candidates?\n\n*   Support the ecosystem - Contributors should focus on returning the highest value to the ecosystem and look to solve the largest problems the community is facing at the time. Those problem areas could include support for open source SDKs, coordination, missing tooling, governance issues, improving user experience etc.\n*   Support the community - Contributors should understand the ecosystem and be able to help the community where it''s needed. That could be answering questions, pointing people to the right resources or bringing more awareness to different areas of the ecosystem that need support.\n*   High collaboration - Contributors have the power to be the glue that brings the community together and identifies overlap and duplicated efforts. The community benefits by contributors spending time understanding different related projects and bringing those together where it is a benefit to them and the ecosystem.\n*   High participation - To be highly effective contributors will need to understand what is happening across the ecosystem to the best of their ability. Contributors may sensibly focus on one or a few areas within the ecosystem where they ensure they are up to date and are aware of the problems, projects, teams and roadmap.\n*   Flexible - Contributors will be most impactful if they are able to be flexible in a fast moving environment and move to where they can have a high impact.\n\n  \n\nWhat should contributors report?\n\n*   Progress reports - Contributors should report weekly progress reports on what they are working on in the community, blockers and anything else relevant\n*   KPI reports - Contributors would not need to report KPI reports like idea proposals do. Instead they would focus on increased regularity of progress reports that detail how they are contributing to the ecosystem.\n*   Gather community feedback - The contributor should provide a way for the community to provide feedback to what they are working on to help guide changes of focus and priority. The contributor will be the decider of what they work on and can provide justifications for that which would be taken into account for any future funding rounds for being a contributor again.\n\n  \n\nWhat sort of candidates are most suitable?\n\n*   Approachable - You understand the community will reach out to you regularly and will need to be friendly and supportive to community members.\n*   Outcome focussed - You understand that the problems within any ecosystem are complex and take time to overcome but are able to communicate and collaborate on finding solutions.\n*   Open minded - You have insights but are always open to new ideas on how to solve a problem. You look to include all perspectives when solving problems.\n*   Pragmatic - You understand solving problems often doesn''t start with the perfect solution. You understand the difference between short and long term thinking and how to prioritise what is most important and achievable.\n\n  \n\nWhat candidates may be less suitable?\n\n*   Single idea focussed - You have a great idea and want to work on it full time. This candidate is less suitable as contributors should not be tied to a single idea. Instead contributors are a collaborative force that helps pull ideas and teams together. This person can make a proposal for their idea if that''s where they want to focus their time where the contributors league could help them instead!\n*   Wants full autonomy and independence - Candidates will need to communicate and collaborate with many community members, ideas and projects regularly. If a candidate wants full autonomy and independence to solve problems then they are more suited to idea focussed proposals rather than joining the contributors league.\n\n  \n\nCommunity advisors - How candidates should be assessed\n\n*   Feasibility - How likely is it that the candidate will be effective in working in the areas of focus they detailed? Do their professional background, skills, experiences and existing contributions support that they will be able to fulfil that role?\n*   Impact - How impactful are the areas of focus that the candidate has listed? Is their chosen area of focus currently lacking contributors? Does that area of focus have hard to find expertise that makes it higher value to the ecosystem?\n*   Auditability - What evidence is given on any of their existing contributions made to the community? Is the approach to prioritisation and feedback given fair and justified? Is there any strong evidence of their existing collaboration and participation in the community?\n\n  \n\nChallenge team - What duties will support success\n\n*   Proposal support - Help candidates propose a fair budget and salary expectations for their application. Guide candidates to add more proof of existing contributions or professional background where necessary.\n*   Progress report reviews - Check on execution of reported progress by candidates to ensure it meets the standards and expectations of the community. Flag and report candidates where necessary for wider community review.\n\n  \n\nFuture ideas to consider with this challenge\n\n*   Reputation building - The contributors league could become a vital part of the Cardano ecosystem where the community could issue credentials or vote on members of the workers league for helping in certain areas. Some examples could be for high impact help in areas such as development, coordination, design, planning.\n*   Bonuses - Top contributors league members could be voted for in a governance process and be given a bonus reward for the impact of their contributions. This could make being a contributor very lucrative and align financial incentives well towards those that make large effort contributions that positively benefit the ecosystem.", "importance": "Cardano needs more of the community working full time in the ecosystem so it can reach its potential", "goal": "Community members solving important problems in Cardano are funded so that they can work full time in the ecosystem", "metrics": "The key metrics to measure for contributors from the contributors league would include:\n\n*   Number of contributions (Code commits, events organised, coordination support between teams)\n*   Community support (Conversations with and contributions to new and existing projects and community members)"}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "Reputation systems constitute one of the few work- able mechanisms for distributed applications in which users can be made accountable for their actions. By collecting user experiences in reputation profiles, participants are encouraged to interact more with well-behaving peers hence better online behavior is motivated.  \n\n  \n\nCreating a transparent and comprehensible reputation system that will increase trust in order set the base for growing adoption of Cardano in general through practical use cases - and in Project Catalyst for proposers, voters, (veteran) community advisors.\n\nWhy is it important (extended):\n\nProject Catalyst attracts new community members from fund to fund. To grow even more and, equally important, to increase the activity level of all members, it is very important that all roles have some predictability in the outcome of the responsibilities they take on. A proposer relies on Community Advisors (CAs). CAs on Veteran Community Advisors (VCAs) and voters on VCAs. When people trust the dependent role, they are more likely to participate (repeatedly). To fuel the continued development of Project Catalyst, we need to increase the level of trust with a reputation system.\n\nBut a reputation system is not only necessary for Project Catalyst, it''s crucial for any decentralized or distributed governance system. Therefore, this challenge is created to support ideas, projects and initiatives that help to develop a valid reputation model that can be used for various use cases to build trust among people and systems.\u00a0\n\nHow success looks like (extended):\n\n*   For Cardano:\n\nA functional and valid reputation system will accelerate the adaptation of decentralized systems in voting, governance, economy and society. As part of this challenge, proposals are sought that map and build trust and reputation via decentralized systems on the Cardano Blockchain.\n\n*   For Project Catalyst:\n\nActive community members help Cardano grow via Project Catalyst. Entrepreneurs and developers get their proposals funded with the help of trusted (veteran) community advisors and voters. All participants have the feeling of transparency, trust, collaboration, objectivity, community driven decisions, and success.\n\nCardano and Project Catalyst have a maturing governance model that helps growing participants to take the guided path through the process, learn and improve from one fund to the next one. Quick innovations and iterations help the members to contribute and benefit from its growth in parallel. A growing fund combined with growing trust attracts even more entrepreneurs, developers, investors, advisors and voters to the ecosystem and helps all community members to become successful.\n\nGuiding questions:\n\n*   How can we be confident in the outcome of a reviewing and/or voting process?\n*   How can we exchange based on trust build by recommendation system?\n*   Do we need to rate each other in order to build trust through reputation?\n*   Who can vote whom up/down and why?\n*   How do we collect and weight ratings?\n*   How can we keep the reputation system effective?\n*   How can we build a transparent reputation system?\n*   How can we create sustainable and accurate expectations of future interactions?\n*   What are the tools that we need to prioritize first?\n*   How can we motivate users to provide feedback?\n*   How can we convince users to provide elicit honest feedback?\n*   How do we avoid fake reputation?\n*   How do we avoid the risk of pooled-reputation (I vote for you, you for me)?\n*   What do our community members want, and how do they get it from the Cardano governance model?\n*   What would make a community member motivated to actively participate in the Catalyst experience?\n\n  \n\nPotential directions:\n\n*   Building prototypes for different use cases and industries: eg. in governance/voting, media, research, etc.\u00a0\n*   Definition of ''metrics'' for a reputation system\n*   Identify ways to vote to build trust and reputation\n*   Identify ways to comment on ''wrong feedback'' and identify fake comments\n*   Qualitative research\n*   Quantitative research\n\n  \n\nBudget explanation:\n\nThis challenge supports ideas, projects and initiatives to create various reputation models over the next 6 month.

    '{"brief": "As in Africa, raising the awareness levels of regular people in East Asia about blockchain and the Cardano network should be a priority for the Catalyst community. In this challenge, we provide funding for people who have learned about Cardano to take advantage of the community''s support and build on or use the Cardano network.\n\nThe nature of the proposals for this challenge is open-ended. Their only requirement is to originate or focus on East Asia and include east Asian team members or focus on East Asian participants.\n\nFor instance, the overwhelming majority of Stake Pools reside in North America and Europe. The Cardano network will be more resilient when Stake Pools are evenly distributed across the globe. The Catalyst community needs to step up and intentionally make that happen.\n\nCardano started life in East Asia (Japan and Hong Kong), and Emurgo focuses on East Asia. Let''s build upon that.\n\nWhat this is:\n\nA call to action; Activate the Cardano community''s ability to recognise, reward the opportunity to make the world a better place. East Asia is fertile ground for the adoption of Cardano. The return on intention (ROI) is likely to be high because projects in young and developing economies face less economic inertia.\n\nAddressing different parts of the world directly and intentionally through funding challenges makes our community more accessible.

    '{"brief": "Context\n\nIn the first iterations, *Catalyst* started as a Challenge proposed by the Catalyst team. Initially, the majority of its budget was destined to the Developer Ecosystem. For instance, in Fund 6, the Developer Ecosystem was assigned 1 mil. USD, that was 25% of the total 4 mil. available for the Fund.\n\nIn Fund 7, Catalyst released control of the budget to the community, which was able to choose the destination of the funding through voting. Unfortunately, the Developer Ecosystem challenge proposed for F7 was rejected because it did not receive enough votes. This led to the lack of an important resource stream that could have been used for the development of the Cardano technology.\n\nThe Open Source Development Ecosystem Challenge\n\nThe OSDE challenge aims to provide a stream of resources to teams that want to develop their projects and contribute back to the community by sharing part of their efforts in terms of open source projects, open-source frameworks, and accessible knowledge.\n\nThe main idea is that *projects funded by the community* can both *generate business value* retained by the teams, *and* at the same time *contribute back to the community*\u00a0by improving the ecosystem itself.\n\nFor example, a team can be funded to develop a project; *generate business value* by leveraging a profitable idea, and *share the non-core-business* part of their work in terms of *shared knowledge* or in terms of *building frameworks or projects* with other teams - such that is possible *to solve complex problems by joining minds and dividing the efforts across different teams*.\n\nMotivation\n\nCatalyst exists to gradually work towards the final stage of the roadmap of Cardano: Voltaire. We are building tools to *support new forms of governance and collaboration, on top of technology that is still being developed*. The development of this technology itself, in the end, will have to become part of this same process as well. Such a complex and daunting task requires experts from a variety of disciplines to work together with a common goal.\n\nGuiding questions:\n\n*   How can we ensure future efforts benefit from the work that is funded today?\n*   How do we align between different open source community efforts?\n*   What are the next steps to fuse IOG development with the community?\n*   How can we encourage experts to collaborate and share their knowledge and work?\n*   How can we develop a sustainable ecosystem while sharing knowledge and efforts?\n\nPossible directions:\n\n*   Education for development in the Cardano & Catalyst ecosystem\n*   Developing common tools, frameworks, core infrastructures, or proof of concepts\n*   Incentive systems for development & hosting\n*   Common audited repositories & overviews of existing solutions\n*   Organizing events to bring the development ecosystem together\n*   Collaboration to improve interoperability within the ecosystem\u00a0\n\n  \n\n*Note*\n\nFor a challenge with this budget and these aspirations, it is essential to have a *broad consensus*. If that support is present, then the results will be owned by the same ecosystem that supports its development.\u00a0\n\n*Complimentary Challenges*\n\nThis challenge is about growing the open-source ecosystem by funding and improving projects that should share part of their efforts to make the ecosystem grow, and it is *not to be confused* with:\n\n*   The Developer Ecosystem Challenge \\[1 mil\\](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Developer-Ecosystem/384822-48088) that focus on developer ecosystem not necessarily open source.\n*   The Open Standards & Interoperability Challenge \\[500k\\](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Open-Standards-Interoperability/383619-48088) that aims to establish standards, processes, and foster interoperability.\u00a0\n\nWe have aligned our efforts with these other challenges and aligned our budgets. We feel there is space for all three. Many open source projects start out as closed source and many contributors to open source projects started out as people using the open source as part of their own private project. We feel that having both is would lead to the best of both worlds. Splitting the challenge helps create a less competitive environment for the Open Source projects.", "importance": "We need to grow an entire ecosystem of experts to build and maintain the foundations of CardanoCatalyst together with the current IOG teams", "goal": "A growing number of experts join forces to build collaboratively on community owned infrastructure, tooling, standards, libraries and docs", "metrics": " increase the number and the quality of Cardano Open Source projects\n\n increase the number of contributors\n\n increase of open source tools and frameworks from the community for the community (dog-fooding)"}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "This challenge is targeted at continents such as Africa with huge potential to adopt Cardano but faced with barriers like sub par electricity provision and limited internet penetration.\n\nFor projects in Africa and similar communities to start building on Cardano, the issue of accessibility needs to be addressed.\n\nForemost among them are the basic infrastructure needs that many in the western world take for granted, but are often things that some communities in other parts of the world do not commonly have available at a level that will support integration and development of such a highly technical blockchain ecosystem.\u00a0\n\n*   Electrical supply with UPS integration and backup generators is something that must be secured as local power companies are frequently subject to brownouts/blackouts.\n*   Internet accessibility that will support inter-hub and international cyber-meetings as well as stake-pool operations is something that must be pursued and acquired.\n\nIn addition to those basic needs are also the hardware required to support developers, teachers, students and the associated community outreach each hub is planning.\n\nHow this challenge addresses the problem\n\nThe issue of access is already a well articulated problem. Governments and private entities like World Mobile are hard at work building infrastructure.\n\nThis challenge will therefore look for local implementors to acquire, equip and resource local community centres/hubs where communities can be mobilized to solve problems on Cardano", "importance": "Without support, electricity and internet accessibility challenges will hamstring Cardano''s overall potential and goal to bank the unbanked", "goal": "Create well resourced Community Centres in local communities targeted at solving local problems on Cardano to expand Cardano''s market", "metrics": "++The on the ground metrics to ensure this challenge is delivered on++\n\n*   Number of hubs/community centres with back-up and stable power supply with high-speed internet access, designed to maintain a stake pool operation\n*   Number of hubs/community centres with space and equipment for classes and work\n*   Number of new community members onboarded (e.g. devs, enterprises, thought leaders etc.)\n*   Feedback on progress from successful proposals regardless of failure or success\n*   Novelty and appropriateness of solutions (hard to quantify, easy to see)\n*   Proposals should come from countries with 50% or less internet penetration.\n\n++Rationale for Budget++\n\nThis challenge anticipates an average budget of $35k space, equipment and operating costs\u00a0 per funding round in 10 locations."}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "This is a challenge that helps Projects on their mission to demonstrate that Cardano can allocate resources aligned with a specific interest or greater good which has been neclected by the traditional System for decades by now. The best way to fight Co2 emissions is by reducing energy-consumption. But this is not enough we need to\u00a0make Cardano itself Climate Positive and surely, if we can make our contributions for the World to be Climate Positive and to make it a regenerative, better place, we should incentivize that with at least a small % of our Potential.\n\nWhat began as a challenge, has turned into a community: Cardano4Climate.\n\nWhile holding weekly meetups for 3 month now we have engaged with many different proposers and Projects. Last funding round as a community, we have identified \\[1\\]more than 12 proposals that were closely related to this challenge and we invited many more into the \\[2\\]sustainability event that we held recently.\n\nWhen talking about the fundamentals of Climate Change itself we would like to encourage you to read up on the papers and the official reports. We specifically refer to the \\[3\\]IPCC reports (we also linked a shorter and easier to read press-release at the bottom):\n\n\"GENEVA, Aug 9 \u2013 Scientists are observing changes in the Earth''s climate in every region and across the whole climate system, according to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report, released today. Many of the changes observed in the climate are unprecedented in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years, and some of the changes already set in motion\u2014such as continued sea level rise\u2014are irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years.\"\n\n\"The report projects that in the coming decades climate changes will increase in all regions. For 1.5\u00b0C of global warming, there will be increasing heat waves, longer warm seasons and shorter cold seasons. At 2\u00b0C of global warming, heat extremes would more often reach critical tolerance thresholds for agriculture and health, the report shows.\"\n\n\u00a0\"Stabilizing the climate will require strong, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and reaching net zero CO2 emissions. Limiting other greenhouse gases and air pollutants, especially methane, could have benefits both for health and the climate\"\n\nGuiding questions\n\n*   What will have the greatest impact on climate change in the short and long term?\n*   What real-world regenerative solutions already exist that would benefit from applications developed on the Cardano blockchain now, and in the near future?\n*   How can we incentivize individuals, local communities, councils and municipal authorities, businesses and governments to prioritize taking action to reduce our overall carbon footprint?\n*   What are the most useful and scalable applications to put Cardano at the forefront of real, actionable solutions which reduce the greenhouse gases we will pass on to future generations?\n*   How can we minimize Cardanos CO2 emissions further or even become Climate positive?\n\nProposal success metrics:\n\n*   How big is the impact on Cardanos self-sustainability?\n*   How big is the impact on Co2 emissions?\n*   How big is the impact on regenerating our planet?\n*   How big is the awareness that will be created?\n*   Is your proposal financially sustainable after funding?\n\n  \n\nBudget rationale\n\nWhen looking for a budget we thought about, how much of our focus should lie on solving this issue from within the Cardano/Catalyst ecosystem. We believe that 1 Million for a first Climate Change Challenge would have been too much since we are a blockchain Fund and not an environmental Fund, but we also believe that there is potential and therefore 3-4% of the Funding seemed reasonable to us.\n\n  \n\nLinks\n\nJoin our Community!\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/Cardano4Climate\n\nPress release on IPCC-report:\n\nhttps://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr/\u00a0  \n\n  \n\nReferences\n\n*   \\[1\\] https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w89O_6R-sqd9WmCTttdaUtwAenckJlZt1nJT2LmatQY/edit#gid=0\n*   \\[2\\] https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Cardano-Catalyst-Community-Network/events/jqqjqsyccqbtb/\n*   \\[3\\] https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/\n\n  \n\n++This is a challenge setting proposal++", "importance": "Legacy systems have failed us on climate change!

Spot solutions for e.g. traceability, supply chain management, identification and payments have been implemented but large scale benefits of this promising technology are yet to be seen. Based on years of rigorous research and development, Cardano is one of the most serious contenders to fulfill this promise.\n\nRecent and upcoming technological developments in Cardano\u2014smart contracts, Yoroi dApp connector, larger block size (higher throughput), sidechains and state channels, to name a few\u2014are gearing Cardano to be ready for large scale adoption in 2022.\n\nLarge corporations, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), platform businesses and highly networked startups have very different types of needs. Their industries may vary from finance and high-tech to agriculture and construction and from simple services to knowledge-intensive business. Yet, at the end of the day, they all need modern tools to keep fulfilling their mission, to remain relevant in global competition and to offer their employees the best tools to do what they were hired to do. Any company wants to engage their partners and employees, serve their customers better, improve their processes, cut costs, increase revenues and expand to new business areas.\n\nBy removing the middle man and automating processes, smart contract blockchain solutions can drive all of the above.\u00a0Cardano can at least partly answer to these needs.\n\nIn this challenge, proposed solutions can be tools, services, products, process improvements, data management solutions (CRM, ERP, MES, DMP etc), decentralized cloud solutions, privacy and security related offerings or even metaverse-related solutions.\n\nIn your proposal, it would be good to outline the extent, limits and scope of the solution readiness-level of the solution, and whether it is e.g.:\n\n*   A Feasibility Study / Proof of Concept / Minimum Viable Product that could be built on Cardano.\n*   An existing business-ready product or service that could be converted to run on Cardano.\n*   A business-oriented training or consultancy service.\n*   An existing blockchain solution brought into the Cardano ecosystem to serve business needs.\n*   A prototype or demo in operational environment\n*   A creation of model of a system or subsystem\n*   A process improvement\n\nWhen submitting proposals, please include the long-term vision, strategy and roadmap as well as short-term deliverables attainable in the next 6-9 months.

    '{"brief": "Events that bring the community together are critical to driving engagement, passion, building connections, and enabling powerful collaboration. These events strengthen the community and introduce and onboard new people to our ecosystem. Events have also been excellent problem-sensing tools that have launched several new teams and initiatives from the collaboration and connections forged during these events. Technology can be cold and impersonal, and community events bring the human touch to our engagements, opening hearts and minds.\n\nThis challenge invites the community to envision and bring about even more engaging and exciting events, catering to an ever-growing and diverse community. We are also already holding many interesting events within the broader Catalyst community. This challenge will ensure that these efforts sustainably provide value to the community.\n\n++Use of the challenge budget:++\n\nEvents require planning, resources, and investment of time from the organizers. The Community Events challenge intends to help pay for those costs as they provide tremendous value to the community. Events can be (and have been) run by passionate volunteers and be of very high quality without remuneration. Still, we should recognize and reward these efforts instead of relying on the volunteer effort needed to run these events sustainably.\n\nSince Project Catalyst is a global community, the focus on these events should be online formats (like Zoom, etc.). Recording these events so people in other locations and time zones can view them will ensure our community''s maximum reach and benefit.\n\n++Guiding questions:++\n\n*   How can we increase meaningful participation in Project Catalyst among all stakeholders?\n*   How can we increase voter-proposer interaction?\n*   How can we increase participation from Stake Pool Operators in Project Catalyst?\n*   How can we onboard and integrate new people into Project Catalyst?\n*   How can we use events to build new teams?\n*   How can workshops increase collaboration in Project Catalyst?\n*   How can active participation in events be increased?\n*   How can the number of participants in events be increased?\n*   How can events help keep the community together?", "importance": "Communitydriven projects like Catalyst need organized events to connect, discuss ideas, solve problems together, and initiate collaboration", "goal": "A diverse community characterized by high engagement, collaborative problem sensing, and strong execution teams.", "metrics": "Active participation in Project Catalyst among all stakeholders:\n\n*   Proposers\n\n1.

The goal is to grow to 100,000 members on IdeaScale by the end of 2021 and certainly well beyond that in 2022 (see April 21, 2021 Town Hall video).\n\nTo ensure diversity in our community, these campaigns should be designed to attract entrepreneurs, marketers, developers, visionaries, community managers, community advisors, etc. to eventually increase active participation in Catalyst and increase voter participation.\n\nAt best, marketers will propose coordinated campaigns to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of their efforts.\n\nUse of the challenge budget:\n\n*   Online marketing campaigns\n*   Event marketing\n\n  \n\nGuiding questions:\n\n*   How can we increase awareness about Project Catalyst?\n*   How can we increase the reach of our activities?\n*   How can we attract new people to Project Catalyst?\n*   How can we accelerate adaption of Cardano?\n\nMake sure your campaign spendings make sense:\n\nTo reach the right audience with online campaigns, they need to be built carefully. It is very easy to waste money on online ads if a campaign is not built properly. For this reason, proposers should create and provide a detailed media plan of how the campaign is built and how they will reach their target audience to ensure the campaign''s success. In addition, proposers should answer the following questions:\n\n*   How do they manage their campaigns?\n*   Why and how are they using the proposed online channel or platform for their marketing efforts?\n*   How do they evaluate their campaigns (metrics, KPIs)?\n*   How does the community have access to campaign data?\n\nThis challenge aims to give professional and experienced marketers the financial framework to use their skills to increase Catalyst''s reach and awareness. Therefore, all proposers are required to submit a detailed media plan and ensure transparency of their activities.\n\n*A media plan is required for all proposers!*\n\nRequirement for Challenge team:\n\nTo coordinate activities among all proposers a challenge team is recommended.

Cardano faces potential scaling problems in 2022 as high demand protocols in DeFi, NFTs and gaming begin and continue being released. With alternative scaling solutions not in place there is a risk of overloading demand on the main chain.\n\nTypes of proposals encouraged\n\nProposers should consider new novel ideas or research, extensions of Hydra functionality or porting over solutions used in other blockchains that would be suitable for Cardano.\n\nProposers are welcome to focus on market specific scalability solutions - for instance a solution could focus on DeFi specifically with decentralized exchanges (DEX''s) as a focus area or other growing markets that could benefit from novel scaling solutions.\n\nScalability topic areas:\n\n*   Rollups (e.g. zero knowledge rollups, optimistic rollups)\n*   Sharding\n*   Sidechains\n*   State channels\n\nSize of proposals\n\nScaling solutions are inherently complex and require significant engineering effort. As a result proposers should not be discouraged from making proposals that request most of the challenge budget. A single proposal team is both welcome and encouraged to request the entire budget if they can demonstrate an articulated plan with the technical expertise to address the challenge of scaling solutions that are suitable for growing Cardano.\n\n  \n\nBudget rationale\n\nHigh technical expertise is needed for scalability solutions. Projects will likely take many months of engineering effort to implement viable solutions.\n\n  \n\nFollow on funding rounds\n\nIf this this challenge setting gets voted in and the proposal(s) submitted show signs they can be impactful then a follow on challenge will be submitted for fund 9 with a larger requested budget to further help the team(s) be able to request further funding.", "importance": "Hydra will not solve every scaling problem in Cardano, more scaling solutions are needed as alternatives", "goal": "Scaling solutions that are introduced and implemented by the community that Cardano projects can start using", "metrics": "*   Number of scaling solutions available to the community to use within their projects\n*   Number of projects launched on any of the new scaling solutions\n*   Novel ideas generated from research on different scaling approaches"}', -- extra

Ideally, these are projects that have a proven user base. Projects that satisfy such criteria are welcome to apply for more than $100,000 if that can be justified and clearly budgeted for.\u00a0  \n  \nFor smaller teams (4-5 people) with proven competence, relevant experience and technical skills with sketches/whitepaper detailing how they would go about to launch their proposal, the budgets would typically be in the range $40,000-$80,000.\n\nFor people with the relevant background but without a full team or completed whitepaper detailing the solution, the project ought to be considered as a research stage project and budgets should less than $10,000.\u00a0\n\nGuiding questions\n\n*   What are the key applications that underpin the application ecosystem on other platforms?\n    \n*   What are the most profitable or most used applications on other ecosystems?\n    \n*   What needs do users of Cardano have that could be solved by new applications?\n    \n*   What applications deliver the highest amount of value with the least amount of technical sophistication?\n    \n\nPotential directions\n\n*   Swaps, both simple and fancy variants (multi-party etc.)\n*   Escrow, both simple and fancy variants\n*   Integrations with existing products\n*   NFT marketplace or facilitator\n*   Solutions utilising the power of smart contracts", "importance": "Quality Dapps and integrations will increase utility & adoption of Cardano.

But in the Cardano Ecosystem we have a set of open source projects that have ++*no standards for basic cross-project integration*++. For instance, there are no standards on how to *document, set-up, and contribute-to projects. Moreover*, there is no *common infrastructure* that the projects can use to *track issues*, and *publish* basic *public information* about the ++*projects funded by the community*++.\n\nWe are of the advise that *we need a set of standards, processes, and infrastructures to be used by the Cardano open source projects*, such that (1) The teams of different O.S. projects\u00a0can easily *collaborate*; (2) New-joiners can easily *discover*, *understand*, *test*, and *contribute* to existing O.S. projects; (3) Cardano O.S. projects can access a pool of basic *infrastructures* and *tools* that are needed.\n\nMotivation\n\nAs mentioned by Charles Hoskinson \\[1\\] \"Cardano code is Open Source, but needs to be managed like a true open source project, like Linux and other O.S. projects \\[..\\]\".\u00a0\n\n\\[1\\]\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T88_XKzi8ms&t=492s\n\nIn order to proceed in this direction, we need to use\u00a0*Catalyst as a governance over a true, vendor-neutral open source and open-standards ecosystem*. To achieve that, we are missing processes (e.g. how the project teams should behave and participate in the ecosystem), and infrastructures (e.g. VCS, CMS, Wiki, Forum, etc.)\n\nGuiding questions:\n\n*   How can we guide the growth of a vendor neutral ecosystem?\n*   How can we build a common identity and increase awareness on Cardano projects?\n*   How can we increase the discoverability and the commercial adoption of our projects?\n*   How can we increase the degree of collaboration across different projects?\n*   How can we lower the barriers and increase open participation to our ecosystem?\n*   How can we provide equal opportunities to all projects no matter the size?\n\nPossible directions:\n\n*   Incentivize collaboration across projects to solve complex problems\n*   Introduce common standards and processes and incentivize their adoption across projects\n*   Provide cross-project infrastructures and tools needed to co-ordinate\n*   Ensure the existence of a cohesive knowledge base\u00a0\n*   Support a network of professional technology ambassadors\u00a0\n\nNote\n\nThis challenge builds on top of the existing *F7 Open Source Developer Ecosystem*\u00a0and is loosely related to\u00a0*F8 Open Source Development Ecosystem* (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Open-Source-Development-Ecosystem/382213-48088)\n\nIndeed, this challenge is about\u00a0establishing standards, processes, and fostering interoperability across O.S. projects, while the \"Open Source\" challenges are more focused on growing the O.S. ecosystem by seed-funding open source projects for future challenges.\n\n*Shortly said*: This challenge is about opennes, standardization, and interoperability across open source projects funded by the community, while the \"open source\" one is about increasing the number/quality of projects.\n\nReferences\n\n\\[OPSTD\\]\u00a0Almeida, Fernando & Jos\u00e9, Oliveira & Jos\u00e9, Cruz.

On the long term, all of the community-funded projects should be open and transparent by following common standards.\n\nThere should be observable improvements: easier to discover projects and find project resources, more intuitive to access project knowledge base (documentation, how-to, etc.), and simple to find and contact project members.\n\nIt should be possible to have project synergies by allowing simple inter-project communication, knowledge sharing, and re-use of existing components/services.\n\nWe should observe an increase in open-source contributions to different projects: both from new joiners and from other people already in the Cardano community\n\nWe should observe an increase in reputability of the Cardano Open Source projects. The measure can be done by looking at media communications of various open source communities."}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "Since the dawn of time, artists have served an important role in human societies through the re-contextualization of the familiar and deriving new meaning from it. This act of unintuitive meaning-making can expand the mental model of a population and create new avenues for critical analysis of our role in history and the human condition as a whole.\n\nArtists have been indispensable in re-imagining new technologies too. It was artists who for instance, turned the field of optics and light-sensitive materials to the engine of photography and film. Like many STEM fields, the blockchain community has thus far not been welcoming to the insights provided by artists. We do enable a level of independence from traditional king-makers of the art world through NFTs but at the end of the day, NFTs have become a financial product, above all else making artworks easier to speculate on.\n\nWe have created a new mode of human communication and organization but have largely handed it to the finance industry; And in doing so, we have alienated a community of creatives who could tell us novel things about this new mode of human connection, further expanding its historical role. It''s as if we''ve invented roads but are only communicating their benefit as a way to make commerce more efficient.\n\nI argue that we urgently need to enable a more ambitious look at artworks USING the blockchain and artworks ABOUT the blockchain. Grants given out by this challenge can serve as an invitation to artists to peel back the curtain on the blockchain as a mode of expression with broad applications.\n\nWe need artists to help the public rethink the blockchain as the new roads.\n\nA 150,000 USD grant should be sufficient to empower at least 4 artists to create ambitious installations, sculptures, or interactive artworks using the Cardano blockchain.\u00a0\n\n\\====\n\nCheck out the following references to better connect with the ideas within this challenge brief draft:\n\n Leonardo Journal of Arts and Technology:\n\nhttps://direct.mit.edu/leon\n\n Representing Theoretical Physics Research in and on Ceramics\n\nhttps://www.knightwebbgallery.com/artist/nadav-drukker/\n\n\\===\n\nSome examples of art ABOUT technology and art USING technology:\n\n Forklift Ballet: The forklift ballet is an homage to the special relationship between humanity and machinity. The machines should become part of us and enhance our humanity. When they do, they disappear and we see only an extended person. The experience of embodying and using the machine is its own pleasure. In the forklift ballet the dance of the machine is actually the dance of the driver/ballerino. The driver has an intimate relationship with the forklift. The driver has embodied the machine. We see expression come through his extended body. When we embody the pen, or the sword, or the piano, or the computer, or the car, or the forklift we can feel pleasure from using it, allowing its machinity to conduct our feeling.\n\nhttps://people.ece.ubc.ca/ssfels/pdfs/forklift.pdf\n\n Portals: Portals is a global public art initiative that connects people around the globe through real-time video audiovisual technology housed inside a gold-painted, converted shipping container or other structure. Individuals and groups enter local Portals and engage with individuals or groups in distant Portals through live, full-body video conferencing. The experience has been described as \"breathing the same air.\" Portals are placed in public spaces such as public squares, museums, university campuses, high-level summits, and refugee camps. Participation is free, and the spaces are maintained by staff called Portal_Curators.\n\nhttps://news.artnet.com/art-world/portals-miami-beach-golden-shipping-container-384461\n\n\\===\n\nAn example of an artistic work using the blockchain:\n\nPlantoid: On the face of it, Plantoid looks like a series of plant-like metal sculptures. Each one of these is associated with a unique digital wallet that accepts cryptocurrency (Bitcoin or Ethereum for now), and viewers are encouraged to send digital money to any of the sculptures they find beautiful or evocative. When a predetermined amount of money collects in one of these wallets, a piece of software triggers a process by which a new artist is commissioned to create another metal sculpture that will be part of Plantoid.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/katmustatea/2018/01/31/meet-plantoid-blockchain-art-with-a-life-of-its-own/?sh=2a667e453f64", "importance": "Blockchain is a new paradigm of human communication but the community and products around it are overwhelmingly businessfinance oriented.", "goal": " Attracting the arts community towards experimentation with blockchain.\n\n Creation of new modes of art and artistic interaction.", "metrics": " A shift in the conversation around blockchains through positive publicity in the arts community beyond NFTs.\n\n Highlighting lesser-known qualities of blockchains beyond ownership, trade, efficiency, reduced cost, etc.\n\n Introduction of a new generation of artists, writers, art historians, and the larger arts community to the unique possibilities afforded by the blockchain beyond NFTs and ownership.\n\n New mental models and framing devices for understanding blockchains, their role in the future of humanity, and the ways in which they illustrate and capture the human condition."}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "Our challenge is an evolution of the mass decentralized identity (DID) adoption challenge from Funding Round 6, connecting everything we are learning with the first Atala PRISM Pioneer Program cohort.\n\nThe second cohort of the Atala PRISM Pioneer Program will kick off once Catalyst Fund 7 is complete. Between now and then, any member of the Catalyst Community inspired to write a proposal will get access to the Atala PRISM Pioneer Program first cohort course materials on Canvas. Please submit your proposal on Ideascale, including your email address, to get an invitation to Canvas.\n\nWith this access, you''ll join the growing Atala PRISM community. Our Atala PRISM product team and engineers will be available via a dedicated Discord channel. Inclusion in our Professional Services Group governance framework foundry. Access to fireside chats with the top leaders in the SSI space, where we''ll discuss trends, use cases, and much more. In addition, we will support the growth of high-value credentials and enable partners from concept, to development, to commercialization.\n\n++Areas of Focus++\n\nInteroperability\n\nMost digital credentials sit on Hyperledger Indy ledgers, including those issued by governments in Germany, Canada, and the UK.\n\nThe best-performing platform will gain the largest market share. For many reasons, we believe our platform is superior. Therefore, Cardano and Atala PRISM must include a plan to interact with these other ecosystems to maximize market share.\n\nWe encourage Catalyst proposals to achieve full interoperability. Deliverables should optimize the user experience (UX) for Atala PRISM credentials while remaining compatible with other platforms.\n\nSelf-governance of Emergent Communities\n\n++DAO Governance in Practice++\n\nNew legislation in Wyoming allows for a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to be registered with the state. We challenge the community to establish a DAO under the new laws. It could manage an impact or development goal with shared common resources governed by the DAO.\n\nWe are curious to see if our community proposes a DAO. With a funded proposal, we could facilitate introductions to legal experts in Wyoming.\n\nThe proposal should consider setting aside funds for legal expenses to establish the DAO and legal documentation.\n\n++Patterns of Commoning++\n\nWe draw inspiration from the work of the Trust Over IP Foundation and the principles from ''Patterns of Commoning.'' We see the potential for innovation by linking communities with shared interests under these principles.\n\nHow can these principles become plug-and-play code as technological primitives that other communities can leverage and unlock exponential growth and adoption?\n\nWe are interested in exploring a rich playground of ideas and bringing these to real-world implementations on Cardano and Atala PRISM.\n\n++Education, Career, and Emergent Reputation Primitives++\n\nMany of our Pioneer and Catalyst-funded projects support education and career programs. One of the defining characteristics of these approaches is the creation of alternatives to accredited education and career paths.\n\nWe need our community to think about developing technology and governance primitives to support any community that wants to establish new education and career paths by providing tools:\n\n*   For onboarding new experts and teachers\n*   For people in the community to develop and grow\n*   For maintaining a reputation as a skilled employee, laborer, consultant, mentor, teacher, etc.\n\nWhen reputation standards change, we need ways to self-heal and self-monitor for bad actors, harmful actions, or bad outcomes.\n\nCircular Supply Chain\n\nThe global supply chain focuses on creating a new economic infrastructure. The goal is replacing or integrating with legacy systems such as record-keeping, bills of lading, centrally managed systems of record, and distribution networks. Centralization has many challenges, the least of which is a lack of resilience in the global supply chain, as we have all seen and continue to experience in the COVID era.\n\nSupply chains tend to start as decentralized. Markets and trade routes emerge from the bottom of the producer market and are aggregated into centralized supply chains, eventually working their way down to the consumer. We want to explore new patterns of commerce in bottom-up supply chains that could open and expand the local reputation network into markets that are currently inaccessible, such as:\n\n*   Regenerative agriculture\n*   Locally produced art\n*   Other forms of local commerce\n\nOn the other side, distribution or demand-driven commerce has the potential to build a market force from the bottom-up that can engage the industrial global supply chain in ways that are not possible without establishing the voice and economic strength of the community digitally.\n\nFor the supply chain challenge, we want to address two significant challenges:\n\n++Small Producer Problem++\n\nHow can we create transparency as the bottom-up process meets the industrialized supply chains, cuts through the centralized distribution markets, and connects directly to the consumer?\n\nFor example, small producers like a family ranch in Wyoming have no way to get information about the value of their product through these global aggregation and distribution networks. Currently, a solution such as the BeefChain project is supporting small ranchers.\n\nThere are multiple issues to overcome. For example, packaging plants are the entry point to the aggregation, so there is little or no incentive to deal with the small producer. We want to address this problem by building general-purpose tooling to assist communities in self-organizing and self-governing production according to agreed standards. We propose that if these communities can connect and grow, they will either:\n\n*   Reach the market through alternative distribution channels to industrial supply chains\n*   Be able to negotiate as a community for better terms to have the values of their products recognized, distributed, and sold with value intact commercially and reputationally.\n\n++The Last-Mile Problem++\n\nHow can a local distributor in a local market interact with global industrial supply chains and be given access to the market that otherwise would be inaccessible due to a lack of economic identity or capital to access the goods at the scale required by industrial supply chains?\n\nThis challenge deals with distributing necessary products to local communities with little market clout or access to financial tools, such as credit, to interact with the industrial supply chain. We''re looking for bottom-up tooling to establish a network of communities. Delegates in those communities can access the finance and credit necessary to interact with the industrial supply chain at the economic scale required for transactions.\n\nAn example of this problem is delivering health care supplies to rural and developing countries and economies. The funds from donors, the government, and other sources are available for these medical supplies. The donors will only release the funds once delivery is verified, and the medical supply companies will only send the goods to port once payment is received.\n\nHowever, local small businesses must maintain transparency and oversight of the goods during delivery and receiving. These businesses do not have the funds or the ability to borrow capital to cover medical supplies costs from the delivery at the port to the hospitals and clinics that need them.\n\nAddressing the challenge of the financial gap is vital. We believe that there is enormous potential to create bottom-up networks of trusted individuals and small businesses to fill this gap.\n\n++A Proposed Pattern Language Outline (example)++\n\nPrimitives\n\n*   Digital Identity\n*   Verifiable Credential (VC)\n*   Verifiable Presentation Request\n*   Verifiable Presentation Proof\n*   Cryptocurrency\n*   Non-fungible token (NFT)\n*   Smart contract\n\nPatterns\n\n*   Trust Registry\n*   Governance Framework\n*   Token Curated Registry\n*   Community member recognition and onboarding process\n*   Establishing Individual Reputation\n*   Community as a whole group Interaction with an external party\n*   Community member as an individual interaction with an external party\n*   Community medium of exchange\n*   Recognition of external Trust Registry\n*   Recognition of external Governance Framework\n*   Acceptance of Governance Framework by an external party\n\nWith that as background, we are suggesting proposals in the following three areas:\n\n1.  Interoperability between Cardano and Indy anchored DIDs/VCs.\n2.  Self-governance of Emergent Communities\n3.  Circular Supply Chain", "importance": "By identifying highvalue credentials, we can establish governance framework foundries for launching pilot programs and driving growth.", "goal": "Discover repeatable patterns that unlock our ability to leverage the Cardano decentralized infrastructure.

    '{"brief": "Turkey is a bridge between Asia and Europe including increased connection with countries in Africa. It has a large and young population of more than 80M people. It is the home of one of the earliest cryptocurrency exchanges, BTCTurk, which was founded in 2013. As such, Turkish people have been some of the earliest adopters of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAccording to Triple A research, ~2.4M of the populace own cryptocurrencies. This makes it the nation with the 19th most cryptocurrency users \\[1\\]. This however does not capture the entire picture as the growth of this number has been 10 fold in the past year \\[2\\]. This massive growth can most directly be attributed to rising prices of cryptocurrencies and to the speedy devaluation of the Turkish Lira (around ~40% against the US Dollar in 2021).\u00a0\n\nDevaluation of the currency has gotten exceedingly worse and is set to continue in the near future. The negative effects are felt throughout the country as wages tumble on a USD basis. Minimum wage is around $220 as of the time of this proposal (nearly half the working population earn min. wage), meaning any funds put to work in Turkey can get lots of involvement from the local population.\u00a0  \n\nDespite this growth, Cardano adoption is very low. Although there is an ADA trading community of around 2853 people just in the telegram group, there is currently no broader Cardano community. Majority of the investors in the trading group were drawn to ADA by the performance of the cryptocurrency. As a result, trader emotions like fear and greed dominate the conversation within cryptocurrency communities, resulting in misinformation about the broader Cardano community. As such, a Turkish Cardano community is sorely needed to raise awareness of the vision of Cardano beyond the token price.\n\nWe the proposers of this challenge are trying to do so and bring more qualified Turkish people into the Cardano community. However, we are just a group of three within Project Catalyst with a broader network of around 20 that are involved in cryptocurrencies in Turkey. If the real value of Cardano can be demonstrated in Turkey, this number will dramatically increase. This is especially true given that the majority of young people are interested in participating in international projects. However, they face language obstacles and lack some of the relevant competencies. Therefore more initiatives are needed to realize the potential of Turkey and to aid the global adoption of Cardano.\n\nGiven these points, what could Turkey offer the Cardano community back in return? Turkey has great potential in its qualified IT and cybersecurity personnel built thanks in part to a solid financial services sector. It also has a large pool of young, active and forward looking individuals, looking to contribute to their communities. This challenge aims to bring this potential to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nGuiding questions\n\n*   How can we involve general ADA holders in project Catalyst in Turkey?\n*   How can we increase number of SPOs from Turkey?\n*   How can we increase more meaningful participation from Turkey?\n*   How can we encourage new members to utilize the tools and services available for onboarding?\n*   How can we localize the existing materials?\n\nChallange Team\n\nCem Karaca\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ckaraca\n\n\u00d6zg\u00fcr Ya\u015far Akyar\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ozguryasarakyar/\n\n\u00c7a\u011fkan Acarbay\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/%C3%A7a%C4%9Fkan-acarbay-b2210b136/\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-turkey/.\n\n\\[2\\] https://www.paribu.com/blog/en/news/paribu-has-published-the-results-of-the-most-comprehensive-cryptocurrency-survey-cryptocurrency-use-in-turkey-has-increased-by-10-times/", "importance": "Decentralisation and resilience of Cardano is based on the inclusion of different locations including those communities not involved.", "goal": "Motivated community of developers, SPOs, stakers, voters, challange teams collaborating for the growth of Cardano from Turkey in 2023.", "metrics": "We will track and publish measurement of the challenge based on following metrics  \n\n*   A number of proposals under this challenge.\n*   A number of funded proposals under this challenge.\n*   Average CA scores on proposals.\n*   A number of accounts under on proposal under this challenge.\n\nProposals aim at achieving the success of this challenge will be measured throughout the following metrics  \n\n*   Number of stake pools running in Turkey,\n*   The number of Project Catalyst proposals from Turkey,\n*   Number of developers participating in the Cardano Developer Program from Turkey,\n*   Increased number of educational tools about the Cardano in Turkish,\n*   Increased awareness about the Cardano blockchain in Turkish speaking communities,\n*   The number of roles taken in Project Catalyst as CA, general voters, challenge team members, members of the catalyst circle by Turkish individuals."}', -- extra

    '{"brief": "\\*\"Having a funding round that focuses on Africa is a win, win, win scenario. Africa wins by getting some backing. Commercial projects that are already building up in Africa win, because they get the signal of support from our community. Cardano holders win when there is an encouraging environment for mass adoption anywhere.\\*Focussing on Africa is a strategy that has often been promoted and is openly pursued by IOG and Charles Hoskinson.\u00a0*The ROI is likely to be high because community sponsored projects are better run in young and developing economies.\"* Greg Bell; (originator of the Grow Cardano series)\n\nThroughout human history and civilization, it has been that every few centuries or so a confluence of factors align\u00a0to transition us from one phase of development to another; The first and second industrial revolutions are prime examples. Right now we are barely out of the Web2 revolution and a fourth Industrial revolution or Web3 is upon us.\u00a0\n\nAlthough Africa did not play a key role in the first, second or third industrial revolution, it is poised to be a leader in Web 3.0 technology and those with foresight are positioning themselves strategically.\u00a0\n\nThe Cardano community can be one of these visionaries. Let''s be serious about seeding long term projects in Africa to capture a large share of an important emerging market.\n\n++Rationale for budget++\n\nLet''s be frank here. We need much more than 250k to continue seeding Cardano in Africa. We are asking for this amount because of Catalyst voting patterns; in that $250k is better than $0 and Wada and Partners can still take advantage of other challenge categories to help expand Cardano in Africa.", "importance": "The ''Grow Africa'' challenge is central to a key initiative of Cardano''s, expanding into Africa.

This requires a multitude of services. In the process of empowering the community to take over more and more decisions and control, such services\u00a0need to be provided with reliable continuity. This can be services like creation (and lifecycle managing) supportive tools, templates, services supporting events & processes, services like supporting risk-assessment & risk management, portfolio management and many more.\u00a0\n\nIn order to be efficient and effective, such services require stable teams within these service providers. As a consequence, this needs a more stable funding than the current proposing from one Catalyst fund to the next.\u00a0New ways of funding will be required, so that we can cover both needs:\n\n1.  Accountability and flexibility on side of the community and\u00a0\n\n2.  More stability for recruiting and keeping highly qualified teams on side of the service provider.\u00a0\n\nA industry-proven model for such service agreements are quarterly-rolling agreements with degressive bindingness (always 100%, 80%, 50% 25% quarterly degressive bindingness of an agreed amount for a clearly defined service). Every quarter or fund, this needs to be renewed for qualifying again for 100%, no renewal means fading out of the funding in e.g. a controlled 80%, 50%, 25% way.\u00a0\n\nGoals of this Challenge Setting are\n\n1.  Providing a funding-home = identifying such valuable ongoing services to the community and at first keep doing this in the traditional Catalyst funding for fund 8\n\n2.  Starting a careful process together with this selected group of service providers that is determined to find a new funding-model (e.g. as outlined above) step by step - of course hand-in-hand with the Catalyst / Voltaire progress.

    '{"brief": "After reviewing the archived proposals from Funds 3-6 it became clear that there was a need for this challenge topic. There''s a lot of ongoing interest in connecting Cardano to the real world... and countless proposals relating to this broad area in past rounds have been approved by vote but then unable to be funded for lack of funds. So we need a challenge topic fund to address these directly.\n\nWhether it''s about talking to the real world via IOT control, or listening to the real world via oracles and related technologies, or representing\u00a0the real world in a liquid form by securitizing assets, they all have one thing in common: robustly moving information back and forth between the chain and the real world. But so far most approaches to getting information on and off the chain rely on old-world thinking. Some authority must be empowered to act as an interface, whether it''s an oracle or a securities broker or an IOT gateway. Imagine how much better we could do! Crypto hardware embedded in physical endpoints could make the chain aware of each individual item of interest for sensing, control, or trade. Trusted verification could be implemented in a decentralized way using cleverly designed stake pool contracts. And who knows how many more innovations will appear over time?\n\nThe first big decentralized ledger system was only an accounting and value exchange system. But most of the innovations since then have embraced the broader vision of bringing the benefits of DLT to the entire world of potential computing applications:\u00a0decentralization, individual sovereignty, efficiency, and trust, without compromising one for the other. This challenge setting proposal will ensure that the Cardano ecosystem stays at the forefront.\n\nEXAMPLE SCENARIO\n\nThe enormous boom in NFT trade shows how much interest there is in using DLT to securitize and trade non-cash assets. This boom has taken place despite the limitations of current NFTs, particularly the concern that there''s no guarantee that the purchaser is getting ownership of an artwork\u2014or ownership of anything at all, for that matter.\n\nIf NFTs could securely, verifiably represent real ownership of arbitrary physical goods it would open up the possibility of nearly all commodities markets becoming accessible to blockchain-based trading, while undermining the power and dominance of the entrenched financial institutions that currently control all commodities and securities trades.\u00a0\n\nBut in order for this revolution in decentralization and empowerment to take place, the technology must be created to allow it. A successful system will have to combine technical elements such as low-cost embedded cryptographic hardware, considerations of game theory and economics, as well as clever development of contracts and trading/minting policies, in order to answer questions like:\n\nWho is responsible for validating or certifying a token (etc.) that represents a particular good or asset?\n\nWhy can they be trusted? What are the incentives?\n\nHow can a certified token (etc.) be independently cross-checked? What information must be transparent?\n\nAre there punitive incentives, or just positive? By what mechanism are they imposed?\n\nRATIONALE FOR BUDGET DISTRIBUTION\n\nTo encourage greater diversity of funded teams and proposals each team can request up to $62,500 USD (25%) of the total $250,000 USD total budget.\n\nE.g.\n\nTeam A with 2 proposals of $31,250 USD\n\nTeam B with 1 proposal of $62,500 USD\n\nTeam C with 1 proposal of $40,000 USD + 1 proposal of $22,500 USD\n\nIt is important to note that 25% is the maximum amount of aggregated budget that the same team can request in this challenge, but any amount below that can be requested. This means that the challenge will have space for at least 4 proposals from different teams, which guarantees greater chances for teams with less popularity and that may be overshadowed by more popular teams in the community.\n\nCONTACT INFO\n\nIf you would like to know more please feel free to reach out to me at:\n\ndavid@carbonno.org\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/davidmperlman/  \n\nTHEME SONG\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 IO to the world, Cardano''s here\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Let earth receive blockchain!\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Let every Dapp\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Receive and send\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Data from everything,\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And data to everything,\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And token, and tokenize everything.\n\nSee attachment for sheet music!", "importance": "Numerous proposals in this area have appeared in the past.

May people get turn off by investing, so most people would not actually learn about cardano until they are an investor because it is still under \"crypto\" to the general public.\n\nI think when cardano is able to introduce more hardware that people will buy and use, then the story will start to change significantly because it''s not longer just \"crypto\" and speculation.\n\nFor example, There are likely many craftsmen that make awesome knifes in the cardano network. There should be a way for that person to brand their knifes under cardano. In order to brand it under cardano, there needs to be some level of standards to ensure high quality hardware products. Kinda like Michelin Stars for restaurants. We can have levels of quality on hardware that have been verified by the cardano''s advisor that focuses on ensuring high quality products.\n\nI think this is also a very important macro trend because one of the biggest issues we have today is that people are buying a lot of cheap and low quality product that does not last. This is not a great use of resource, and it also cost consumers more money over time. People used to old very high-quality products over a very long time, but things have changed since. I think cardano can help make the shift to make people start wanting to own more high quality products.\u00a0\n\nPersonally, I''ve been designing hardware for the last 6 years now for spacex, and now i really want to start designing things for the open source world so more people can enjoy awesome open source products. Having a way to enable this will take a lot of the hardware engineering resources from centralized hard corporations into the decentralized world. So whatever is designed is no longer own by large companies that takes a large amount of the value, and allow that value get pass back down to the engineer or consumers. I think if we do this right, we can technically build the next NASA/SpaceX if we wanted to.\n\n  \n\nI think 500k might be a good budget to start for the next round. It will cost more for R&D because hardware is more expensive.", "importance": "Most people do not understand the digital world still.

I want to make it clear that this is all in the rules of the game, but it doesn''t mean that it is good for decentralization.\n\nWe know that the K parameter and pledge are important for defining the theoretical number of SPOs, but marketing capacity and social outreach distort the playing field, harming and overshadowing small SPOs.\n\nHow can we level the playing field with sustainable, rational and aove all, free market incentives?\n\nFurthermore, Catalyst has been an amazing funding option for developers in the Cardano community, but the 3-month cycle of each Fund can dampen innovation. Some projects need quick funding sources. Some projects could be funded by the community itself. Not every good proposal fits a challenge. There is demand for alternative funding models for developers and builders, so why not create space for them outside Catalyst regular 3 month cycle funding?\n\nEach team can request up to 20% of the total $300,000 USD budget\n\nE.g.\n\nTeam A with 2 proposals of $30,000 USD\n\nTeam B with 4 proposals of $15,000 USD\n\nTeam C with 1 proposal of $60,000 USD\n\nTeam D with 1 proposal of $15,000 USD + 1 proposal of $45,000 USD\n\nThe idea of limiting a team to requesting up to 25% of the budget is to allow for a greater diversity of ideas and approaches to solving the problem.  \n\nIt is important to note that 20% is the maximum, any amount below that can be requested. This means that the challenge will have space for at least 5 proposals from different teams, which guarantees greater chances for teams with less popularity and that may be overshadowed by more popular teams in the community.\n\nDue to the urgency of the issue related to the frequent retirement of several small SPOs and the difficulty in increasing the viability/profitability of small SPOs/developers I believe the budget would be appropriate.\n\nFurthermore, at Fund7 we had two challenges funded related to SPOs and there is a good demand for proposals in these challenges..\n\nPotential Directions\n\n*   Marketing teams to promote small SPOs\n*   Alternative Reward Models (FISO, NFT aidrops)\n*   Crowdfunding and crowdsourcing platforms\n*   Creating advanced filters for selecting small SPOs\n*   Multi delegation research\n*   Explorers and adaptation of wallets to build multi delegation portfolios\n\nIn this video Sebastien Guillemot( Former co-VP of Engineering at Emurgo and dcSpark CTO and co founder) explains the importance of pools distribution(consensus distribution) to increase reliability and assurances for users and dapps on the blockchain:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=xwlN3DZvmgQ&feature=emb_logo", "importance": "To achieve greater decentralization and resilience in the blockchain through sustainabilityfeasibility for small SPOs and devs.", "goal": "Small SPOs and developers have more options, services and tools to get delegates and funding + Greater distribution in block minting.", "metrics": "*   Number of onboarded devs outside Catalyst funding\n*   Number of onboarded teams outside Catalyst funding\n*   Number of pools created\\*\n*   Number of delegates over time\\*\n*   Number of pools retiring over time (0, 3, 6 and 12 months after this challenge)\n*   Ratio between retiring pools/total operating pools over time (0, 3, 6 and 12 months after this challenge)\n*   Percentage of delegation distribution in ALL pools over time (0, 3, 6 and 12 months after funding)\n\n\\*Metrics should be evaluated for pools benefiting from proposals funded by this challenge"}', -- extra

The infrastructure being created for the Lovelace World launchpad will be leveraged to optimize the management and effect of the treasury.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nCommunity engagement\n\nLovelace will utilize it''s extensive social media presence and partner network, to attract new projects to the Cardano NFT ecosystem & promote this treasury.\n\nFund 7 Allocation\n\n*   All funds will be redistributed to the community supported projects via voting.\n*   Lovelace will only act as a custodian, procurer and promoter of this treasury.\u00a0\n*   After the first funding round is completed, the treasury funding will continue to follow future Catalyst funding rounds.\n*   Once the initial treasury has been completely distributed, a new funding proposal will be submitted to Catalyst  \n    \n\nROADMAP\n\nQ1 2022\n\n*   Receive fund allocation and present a detailed schedule to the community, based on new Catalyst schedule for Fund 8, when it is released\n*   Integrate voting mechanism\n*   Start promotion of fund thesis to cross-chain communities\n\nQ2 2022\n\n*   Start fund distribution after funding round voting is completed\n*   Offer support to selected projects\n\n  \n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT LOVELACE WORLD''S LACEUP LAUNCHPAD\n\nThe Lovelace LaceUp Launchpad is a destination for new projects and games to launch their high-utility NFTs to pre-sell functionality within their respective platforms.\n\nLaceUp is unique in that it includes a service to consult on the development of a project''s NFT issuance strategy and is designed specifically for new NFT sales and releases.\n\nAll LaceUp listings are vetted and require an application and due diligence process. Only high-utility NFTs that have functionality within their own metaverse as well as cross-functionality with other metaverse projects will be considered for listing. This assures that only NFTs with strong secondary market potential are launched on our platform, protecting NFT purchasers, while building long-lasting economies for their projects.\n\nLaceUp listings are promoted, marketed, and shared with Lovelace''s community of followers, previous sale participants as well as blockchain focused venture capital funds and high-net worth buyers. NFT buyers can participate to collect and/or participate within the issuers'' ecosystem and metaverse. We expect a very diverse array of projects from games, collectibles, high-quality artwork with built-in economies to decentralized applications, and infrastructure projects.\n\nThe LaceUp launchpad ecosystem consists of two primary participants:\n\n*Project and NFT Issuer*\n\nProjects work closely with the Lovelace team to conceptualize, create, and issue their NFTs on LaceUp. NFTs sales may be linked to airdropped project tokens, unlock special functionality, enhance gaming, provide gamified yields, and/or provide unique experiences to their holders.\n\n*NFT Purchaser*\n\nNFT Purchasers buy NFTs listed on LaceUp and hold them within their wallets to gain access to airdropped tokens, unlock special functionality, earn gamified yields and/or receive unique experiences within a projects metaverse.\n\nThe LaceUp launchpad serves as a destination for the release of both third-party developed as well as in-house Lovelace projects.\n\n  \n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT LOVELACE WORLD\n\nWebsite and Social Media:\n\nWebsite: https://lovelace.world/\n\nTwitter (83k+ followers): https://twitter.com/LovelaceWorld\n\nDiscord (12k+ followers): https://discord.com/invite/6w49dSAd5M\n\nTelegram (32k+ followers): https://t.me/lovelaceofficial\n\nSelect Media Coverage:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P4yWlvV9PI\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLrZ0B81vjg\n\nThank you for your consideration!
